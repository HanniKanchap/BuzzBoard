reddit,Experimenting with polls and surveys,"we are exploring a new pattern for polls and surveys

we will provide a stickied post where those seeking feedback can comment with the information about the poll survey and related feedback sought

 history

in order to be fair to our community members we stop people from making these posts in the general feed  we currently get 15 requests each day for this kind of post and it would clog up the list

 upsides

however we want to investigate if a single stickied post like this one to anchor polls and surveys  the post could be a place for those who are interested in opportunities to give back and help students researchers new ventures and others

 downsides

there are downsides that we will continue to watch for

 polls and surveys could be too narrowly focused to be of interest to the whole community
 others are ways for startups to indirectly do promotion or gather data
 in the worst case they can be means to glean inappropriate data from working professionals
 as mods we cannot sufficiently warrant the data collection practices of surveys posted here so caveat emptor and act with caution

we will moreaggressively moderate this kind of activity anything that is abuse will result in a sub ban as well as reporting dangerous activity to the site admins please message the mods if you want support and advice before posting  scary words are for bad actors  it is our interest to support legitimate activity in the healthcare community

 share your thoughts

this is a test  it might not be the right thing and well stop it  
please share your concerns  
please share your interest

reddit,A Hernia Repair Factory,"has anyone tried expanding the shouldice hospital factory style of maximising focus on one procedure  
for those who dont know outside toronto there is a hospital where all they do all day is repair hernias using a method that is used in many hospitals their failure rate is 1 compared to the typical 125 and they dont even rely on super special surgeons three out of 12 werent even trained as general surgeons it also takes less than 12 an hour record time for most hospitals

the chapter from atul gawandes book complications focuses more on the implications of this for algorithms but i would have thought that what would be cool is if primary care and general hospitals focus on diagnoses and referred to these factories more specialised than existing consultants by far on just a handful of procedures that make up the majority of interventions stunts cataract surgery orthroscopies hip replacements etc

reddit,SIBO - the best ever GI consultant - must read,"had private gastrointestinal appointment at 1pm today with osd healthcare in hemel with a dr evans gastroenterologist i presented him with all my documentation

dr evans was empathetic highly knowledgable and a credit to osd healthcare and his profession without doubt the best gi consultant i have ever met

he absolutely agrees with everything im saying but unfortunately the nhs wont recognise or treat sibo because of the cost of rifaximin as it costs them approx 250 for each prescription why cant the government lobby this with nhs and nice to reduce price as you can buy it over the counter for 5 in india

dr evans let me talk for 15 mins and present my document evidence of sibo causing mental health issues and my campaign attempts to bring this to national attention again he agreed with this and had been in several bsg meetings recently to discuss sibo he said that although the data and scientific papers prove the mental health link beyond doubt there is no agreement on breath testing protocol and evidenced based treatment options

so ive got private healthcare with tcs so im very lucky to get a gi consultation paid for but only a before and after consultation based on prescription results

dr evans gi osd hospital has given me a private prescription as follows i have to pay for this myself as tcs healthcare does not cover prescription cost of  chronic conditions

just been to my local chemist wileymans very good in croxley and here is the quote below

rifaximin antibiotic 23940
neomycin antibiotic 7460

so 1 course of these combined to me is 314 i very much doubt caroline wants me to pay for that so will wait to see if nhs will treat which would cost me 990

now im from a fairly middle class background with a reasonable salary what if you are a single mother w nurse and working double shifts to feed 3 kids do you think she really has 300 to pay this and maybe even more for multiple rounds plus consultations we are talking about thousands of pounds

dr evans said that i came across very well with professor level understanding of the gut and brain gut axis disfunction

however he completely agrees with caroline that im not responsible for changing the lives of thousands of people i am responsible for my family wife kids and dog

he said i came across as passionate but hyper and for my own mental health i need to step away from this campaign and concentrate on getting better for myself and my family so thats what im going to do

 some candidates apply to hundreds of jobs without even reading the descriptions  
  
its the interview with the founder of one of these autoapply tools if youre curious heres the link the tricky part is to understand if this creates even more inequality since people that can pay will be able to send more application but seems they solved the problem  
  
apparently they just made the whole thing free and companies are getting assaulted by candidates which i dont even know if its a good or bad thing for them since its free traffic but still

welcome to edmonds washington a bucolic town 30 minutes outside seattle very much like the kind our parents or grandparents might have grown up in edmonds is dead broke see link below  
  
things are so bad the city is planning to sell not only its frances anderson cultural center named in honor a deceased teacher but also the edmonds city hall itself and then evidently pay rent to the new owners you cant make up stuff this bizarre this is the reverse of a rent to own equity building program  
  
i usually blame politicians for this sort of financial disaster and certainly the edmonds village elders deserve a lot of blame but since being edmonds mayor or city councilperson there pays little to no salary its hard to imagine they were passing out voter freebies just to ensure their reelection  
  
possibly simple incompetence and the inability to say no to residents requests is the problem in a town like edmonds everybody knows everybody so if bob picks up the phone and asks for a new stoplight at his streetcorner its hard to push back your kids go to school with bobs kids or bob is the guy you used to mow lawns for 35 years ago these are nice folks and deserve a stoplight and a 10000 square foot culture and leisure center and a yearround 15 minute ferryboat to kingston which would take takes 2 and half hours to reach by car and an oceanfront city hall that view will help it sell quickly imho and 37 public schools which are not for sale at this time and 5 libraries and 3 firehouses and 65 full time police officers about the only thing edmonds doesnt have is its own municipal trash collection you must get your garbage picked up one of the 3 licensed private contractors  
  
edmonds spends 51 million a year to keep its residents happy think of this like running a restaurant with 51 million revenue and expenses which is losing money and customers edmonds population is declining and its average age is increasing now you can understand why the town is on the hook for 40 million in deferred and badly needed basic maintenance for its dining room and kitchen  er i mean public buildings all this is falling into the lap of mike rosen  a retired wildlife filmmaker  who is the newly elected restaurant managermayor  
  
can you see the problem here lack of credentials and financial acumen this is the inevitable outcome of elections which are popularity contests filled with promises on what will be bought or built next  
  
but before you cast shade on the voters and politicians in edmonds consider that this town is a microcosm of the entire usa we have 2 chambers of congress and a supreme court filled with people who have no credentials other than passing some states bar exam and a president who filed bankruptcy 3 times and then was convicted of loan fraud

they lived with a lot less median household incomes adjusted for cost of living were only around 2530k in 1955 compared to 82k today median home sizes were 970 square meet in 1958 today its 2400 square feet with less people per home  the ahs puts the median size of the existing us housing stock at 1790 square feet people mostly werent living in large suburban homes back then people still mostly lived in poorer urban areas and dilapidated rural towns the suburbs they did build were filled with homes that would be considered comically tiny and shoddily built by todays standards theres also a survival bias here the better built larger ones are the only ones which are still around the older ones are largely only still found in poorer areas 

food used to be 1620 of incomes and is as of 2024 10 clothing was around 8 and is today around 12 the images you see of women dressed very fancy that was not the norm this was the norm not because that was the style but because it was all people could afford items we take for granted were many times more expensive back then to the point where a huge portion of homes didnt even have them air conditioners washing machines dishwashers fridges tvs radios toaster ovens microwaves clothing irons etc 

college only 34 of americans in 1960 had a bachelors compared to nearly 40 today tuition was far less expensive but again people lived in poverty the vast majority of people couldnt take 4 years off and spend 6200 adjusted for inflation median tuition costs over 4 years to go to school you had to start working immediately there were no major government programs to help you out  
 

the big elephant in the room of course is housing costs ive already gone over housing sizes so ill skip that but housing is the one thing that has gone up even proportional to income  housing was 23 of peoples income in the 1950s and is today 28 the increase is not nearly as much as people think with the recent spike in prices partially because median incomes have risen so much and also because most people already are locked into their mortgages from years before 


however 23 of 30k is a much much bigger deal than 28 of 82k is  that means you have around 23k left over 28 of 82k means you have 59k left over",672,192,1m2hww6,2025-07-17T20:09:26,https://www.reddit.com/r/economy/comments/1m2hww6/middle_class_living_standards_in_the_1950s_would/,self,Economy,864,0.1955,Neutral,0.23156,Neutral

i go above and beyond for my students if they are hungry and i got snacks its is theirs one of my students was at risk of not graduating and i tutored them and worked it out with their teacher to have them come to the library to do their missed work and they graduated i spend my own money all of the time but im sorry it is not my responsibility to ensure students have resources that the school district should supply

i have two components to this question 

1 is genz really hopeless in an educational sense like less college grads lower grades ect 

2 do you think that there is hidden talent among my generation i also have noticed a lot of my peers have pursued their own interests and become talented at things like programming masters level mathematics engineering animation carpentry and more although this could likely be the result of me taking above grade level classes and thus skewing results

reddit,What if behaviour didn’t need to be managed?,"in schools behaviour is often managed in a variety of ways a common method is the use of a positive behaviour system which issues escalating corrections each time a student needs to be redirected another approach relies more on the teachers interpersonal skills using encouragement challenge or gentle coaxing to guide students towards behaviour that supports learning

there are other methods as well but i want to suggest that the very need to manage behaviour points to a deeper issue i believe this question brings it into focus do students possess more creativity and freedom than school allows

i believe the answer is yes and if that is true perhaps this is the root of many behavioural issues if students were genuinely free to explore what they enjoy and pursue learning without rigid limits perhaps behaviour would not need to be managed at all

i want to propose then that the solution to behaviour challenges lies not in more systems more emphasis on teacher skill or more sanctions it lies in rethinking the purpose of school itself the goal should be to unleash the potential of young people not to constrain it when students and adults are no longer positioned against one another something powerful might emerge",0,3,1m3m2aj,2025-07-19T03:24:43,https://www.reddit.com/r/education/comments/1m3m2aj/what_if_behaviour_didnt_need_to_be_managed/,self,Education,3,0.9852,Positive,0.1709333333333333,Neutral

reddit,How the Supreme Court Is Making Public Education Itself Unconstitutional,"on june 27 the supreme court released its decision in mahmoud v taylor the decision has not received the attention it merits a close reading of the conservative majoritys opinion suggests that the high court is moving toward determining that public schooling violates the first amendment of the constitution the decision could mean the end of public education in america

the author goes through the background and much of the public discussion around the case then points out that there is some language in the ruling that attacks public education more fundamentally

within the courts majority opinion however lies a deeper threat to the existence of public schools because the court determined that exposure to objectionable material violates parents rights policies involving that exposure are subject to strict scrutiny the highest standard of judicial review this level of judicial review requires that the government must demonstrate that the policy in question both serves an interest of the highest order and is narrowly tailored to achieve that interest

the supreme court would no doubt agree that an educated citizenry is a public interest of the highest order what the court does not address is whether public school systems are narrowly tailored to achieve the states goals

the author discusses the history of public education in the united states and then concludes  

all this history is at risk of being jettisoned instead the court has determined that the need to protect students from being exposed to ideas hostile to their familys religious beliefs trumps everything else under the courts new rules no curriculum could ever be constitutional unless parents are always informed in advance and can protect their children from anything objectionable to their specific religious beliefs

given this burden states may be forced to find a more narrowly tailored approach to educating citizens and before we know it one of americas greatest successes one of the most popular american institutions and one of the few we still share in common will be gone",507,105,1m1d9pj,2025-07-16T13:57:16,https://www.reddit.com/r/education/comments/1m1d9pj/how_the_supreme_court_is_making_public_education/,self,Education,612,0.9384,Positive,0.29404,Neutral

reddit,I tried to blow the whistle that parts of the Orion were not properly designed 15 years ago. One of those systems was this side hatch that is still failing. A story about how this happened and how other problems likely exist on the Orion.,"tldr 

 i worked on this side hatch 15 years ago 
 the design of that system and others on orion was totally fraudulent and everyone knew it 
 that system is still causing problems today 
 lockheed and nasa knew about it and chose to squash dissent rather than address the issues 

in 2008 i was hired as an engineer to work on the orion vehicle specifically i was hired as a subcontractor to work on the cias  crew impact attenuation system my subcontractor was ghg

immediately i saw problems the orion had just gone through pdr  preliminary design review yet no one could produce a single piece of mathematics to explain how they got from nothing to the existing cad model there was an fea analysis presented as part of the pdr but no one besides me had any knowledge of fea no one could tell me where that analysis came from

within a few weeks i was approached by another engineer and told that he and i were swapping jobs it was explained to me by him and my manager  kurt miller  that he could not do his job and that he had asked for my position as he and that group lead were friends this was presented as if i could refuse but i would not  because of the implications

my new system was the asds  abort system to docking system it was a one man team and the two previous engineers had both refused to do any work citing a lack of training knowledge and mentorship it had measurements and analysis that were presented in pdr but none had any mathematical support whatsoever they seemed to be made up completely  again

i spent the next year doing a full mathematical design i received no mentorship no help no guidance and not a single question i asked about the process was answered i was always told that we were all learning as we went on

i worked 60 hours a week and when i finished i was told to move into testing again i asked for guidance and was told none existed i was also told to relax for a while years while the remaining systems caught up i asked to be transferred back to my original role or to another position

at this time my yearly review came up i filled out my forms and submitted them to ghg the process should have been that my manager at lm talked with me about the review and then we would agree on the results instead ghg called me over and showed me the review i got 55 marks for pretty much everything  including behavior however there were 3 sentences at the bottom comments section claiming i had a bad attitude

my subcontractor  ghg  told me that my manager claimed to have spoken with me i assured them this was not the case and they immediately refused to speak with me any more kurt miller denied making the comments or submitting the review ghg then claimed that he had reasserted both those things eventually i asked that everyone get in the same room

when the day of the meeting came ghg no showed kurt miller was sitting behind his desk and another manager  kim kuykendall  was present she managed the hatched and latches  including the side hatch that is still causing problems

she explained to me that the negative comments were not in the review and that i was being transferred to her group to work on a test fixture for this side hatch she refused to speak about anything else kurt refused to say anything and instead placed his head on his hands and then rolled back from his desk and placed his head under his desk ghg refused to speak with me and i refused to sign the review

this is the united states space program and these are two non technical engineers with decades of experience

upon getting to my new group i was brought to a room in the basement where a door from a previous program sat  i believe it was gemini i was told that the engineers had copied this design and enlarged it to fit orion specs

here was the problem  orion was much larger and the seal had to be a lot denser because it would be in space longer and could not leak air like gemini these two things meant that the mechanism to open and close the door would not work properly again this was a known issue that i was able to deduce within hours

when i raised this issue and asked how i could design a test fixture when the design of the actual door was going to change i was told that if i needed the design of the hatch  latch to be complete to do the test fixture then this was my job to complete it basically i was told to do their work  again

i politely stated that i would not without being given the role and credit for doing it at this point everyone stopped working with me

i was eventually tasked with writing test software with labview my thesis work was in labview and i was very proficient in it a trial license was put on a computer in a locked training room in the basement and i was told to work on the software when the room was available  after hours

again this is the us space program

not long after the hatches group was brought to a room where our managers  kin kuykendall and paige carr  told us that the design was now considered a failure and we were going to have to start over they made it clear that heads would roll they stated that if you felt that you were responsible and wanted to make a case for remaining you should come talk to them so  walk in and admit that you deserve to be fired and beg to remain i didnt actually work on the design so i wasnt concerned

again this is the us space program

a few days later i was terminated

lockheed and nasa maintain several unwritten policies that apply only to unprotected classes of people one of those is that employees that do not produce for six months can be terminated that means that you can get a review where you are a 55 top performing engineer and then 6 months and 1 day later be terminated with no discussion you wont even know what allegations are made against you much less be given a chance to defend yourself you are just escorted from the building since this takes place in texas and the people have no protection status they have no grounds to sue

i was terminated 6 months and 1 day after moving to the hatches group  six months and 1 day after getting the 55 review

i filed a nasa oig complaint denoting that the three systems i saw  including the side hatch  all had zero mathematical basis for their design and everything else listed above to my surprise i was told that nothing i alleged was denied apparently there was no legal issue with what was done as long as lockheed and nasa didnt lie to the oig

i was never given a reason for my termination i filed a lockheed ethics complaint and was literally laughed at and told that the filing of the complaint established a record of having a bad attitude i was told through the grapevine that i was blamed for the failure the side hatch design basically lockheed tells nasa that the design failed and they fired the guy responsible that destroyed any chance i had at a career anywhere else

the problem is that the remaining people could not do the design initially and they didnt suddenly become competent when i was terminated thus these failures 15 years ago bleed into today because incompetent engineers remain in place

nasa was 100 aware of this because they acknowledged it in my oig complaint 

these issues were known and lockheed and nasa made the conscious decision to terminate an employee with a history of doing things other engineers could not and retain ones that failed repeatedly there were reasons for this based on contractor vs subcontractor and protected vs unprotected classes

i left a lot out for brevity  although i failed at that i have no solutions and ive spent an unfortunate amount of time trying to get nasa and lockheed to do something about these designs theyve spent 30 billion and 20 years on this",1806,167,1m1ga7n,2025-07-16T15:51:51,https://spacenews.com/nasa-studying-issues-with-orion-hatch-design/,default,Space,1973,-0.9983,Negative,-0.017619999999999997,Neutral

there is only 1 earth in our solar system and the habitable zone of temperature for surface water is pretty thin compared to the rest of the solar system but we have many examples of ice moons with some decent evidence of global oceans or pockets of liquid water under the hard icy crust such as triton europa enceladus titan ganymede callisto titania etc and then other bodies have evidence of past oceans which have since frozen over like miranda pluto and ceres pluto is interesting because its moon charon also has evidence of a frozen ocean and itself could inject enough gravitational tidal forces to warm pluto and help maintian a subsurface ocean considering how new and geologically active plutos surface looks despite its tiny size

1066 in england a succession crisis erupts with the death of the prior childless king his successor is able to fend off a viking claimant before ultimately falling in battle to the normans launching the development of the english language and the celticdanishdutchfrench fusion culture that would lead to the worlds first global superpower and the worlds first lasting industrial revolution

1492 the last muslim ruler surrenders in iberia and the process of christianizing or expelling its religious minorities begins an italian by way of portugal and then spain conman who shaved hundreds of km off the earths diameter to secure funding for the journey lands in the caribbean launching the first sustained contact between the old and new worlds and granting europe an unprecedented advantage against the other world civilizations to this day europeans and their descendants control a disproportionate share of world gdp wealth and resources

1776 in the usa the american war of independence evolves into a fullfledged separatist conflict with the adoption of the declaration of independence those who drafted it the framers or founding fathers are revered by american patriots and nationalists to this day and were also respected by the french revolutionaries the usa remains one of the worlds two leading superpowers and the french republic after about a century of turbulence is still an important regional power

1945 the fall of the third reich and later the surrender of imperial japan end wwii historys deadliest war with the axis defeated the soviet union now becomes the largest nonus power and the decolonization process in the old world and caribbean begins shortly thereafter the bombings of hiroshima and nagasaki while tragic launch the atomic age that sees huge peacetime leaps in energy production and scientific knowledge eniac the first fullfledged computer enters service in the last weeks of the year

after all quantum theory consciousness research and even parts of complexity science suggest that not everything about reality can be reduced to current scientific models

reddit,What if robots take our jobs… and give us back our lives?,"this is my personal prediction about the future of work robotics and ubi and how it might lead to a better society if we choose it

the coming age of robotic workers why universal basic income is not just necessary but liberating

we stand on the edge of a technological transformation unlike any before it humanoid robots and ai systems will soon replace the need for most human labor the signs are already here automation in warehouses autonomous vehicles aigenerated content and robots learning to cook clean and even perform surgery what happens when humanoid robots go mainstream

at first glance the thought of mass job replacement feels like a crisis and it is if we try to preserve the current economic model but if we evolve with the technology this could be the very thing that sets humanity free

robots will take our jobs so we must redefine work

in a capitalist system income is tethered to labor but what happens when labor is no longer needed

robots will be faster safer and more reliable at most tasks farming construction retail even care work without universal basic income ubi this shift could result in catastrophic poverty but ubi is not just a safety net its a key to a new society

ubi allows every person to have financial stability regardless of employment recognizing that human worth is not merely tied to productivity its a pivot away from you must work to survive toward you are supported so you can thrive

from digital prompts to physical reality

right now we ask ai to write us code generate art or summarize a book but in the near future well say

hey chatgpt make me a robotic arm that can help me lift heavy things

and it will happen

you wont just download a file youll manifest a physical object crafted by your personal fabrication bot or local robotic lab the barrier between imagination and reality will dissolve

at home humanoid robots will cook dinner wash the floors repair the roof sort laundry and grow your garden every household will have a personal assistant not just digital but physical

instead of spending hours on chores well be free to do whatever invent meditate explore nature build community travel to another planet or just be

augmented professions humans as leaders of robotic teams

not all human roles will disappear some will evolve

a nurse wont be replaced but may lead a team of medical robots that can monitor vitals prepare medications and perform precision surgery a teacher may design adaptive lesson plans powered by ai tutors a construction manager may oversee fleets of bots building homes with superhuman efficiency

in this future humans direct the soul of care creativity and strategy while robots handle the repetition and risk unless you crave the need for speed or whatever

a better society if we choose it

this transformation could go terribly wrong wealth could become concentrated surveillance could expand and people could be left behind but theres another path one where

 ubi supports every citizen with dignity
 ai and robots enhance human potential not replace it
 time becomes abundant and with it purpose
 people are valued for who they are not just for what they produce

we dont have to fear this future we can shape it participatorydemocracy

we can build a world where your passion your presence your perspective is what matters

the robots will work for us the machines will help to build our dreams and we freed from survival mode can finally become what we were meant to be creators explorers healers lovers learners and stewards of the earth and reality",0,147,1m39z62,2025-07-18T18:25:23,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/1m39z62/what_if_robots_take_our_jobs_and_give_us_back_our/,self,147,0.9961,Positive,0.16570000000000001,Neutral,Technology

reddit,I tried a lot of AI medical scribes so you don't have to - my honest review,"hi everyone

im a family doc who also does hospitalist work and im a big tech geek on the side ever since ai scribes started popping up i got super curious that one of them could help out with charting i posted this to the rfamilymedicine group and it got a lot of traction so thought id post the new and updated list here too heres my honest take after spending about a year hopping between them  
  
1 vero scribe 79month  
underdog but this is probably my favourite one that i keep returning to after customizing the template the learn feature is probably the biggest game changer for me and probably many others it learns how you like your notes formatted and outputs all future notes like that accuracy has also been great which is the most important feature to most of us

2 freed ai 99month  
very basic but i think thats the point its dead simple to use which i guess is a plus but it felt like there wasnt much flexibility just a few templates and not much ability to tweak how it works output was good for simple visits but not robust enough for my more complex cases

3 heidi health free tier or 99month  
not a bad scribe and generates consistent notes i paid for the premium because i like my custom templates to generate notes exactly how i like them their chat functionality doesnt answer medical questions which i find a medical scribe should be able to do also they seem really slow to add new features their public roadmap is full of coming soon stuff thats been sitting there forever

4 nabla 119month  
same vibe as freed clean ui but felt barebones if you want something super simple itll do the trick but most of us need more control and accuracy lacks a lot of specialtycustom options

5 scribeberry 99month  
i couldnt get behind this one the output just wasnt accurate for a lot of cases some errors in phrasing missed important negatives in the ros etc did not stick around long enough to keep trying out all the features

6 tali ai 150month  
this ones really popular but my notes came out weirdly formatted and sometimes missed key details or summarized in a way that felt off also they use their chrome plugin as their main selling point but id rather it not see all my web browsing history when im not doing clinical related duties

other stuff i noticed

 privacyphi most claim data is encryptedsecure and stays in uscanadaeurope but always check some are pretty transparent about it others just claim but have no backing
 emr integration none of these are true plugandplay in my emr but most of them have these features on the way
 cost heidi has a free tier but there are not many templates to choose from and i ended up paying the 99month anyways tali came in at the most expensive at 150month for their premium tier

would love to hear what other peoples experiences have been especially if youve used any others i missed i would love to try them out happy to answer any questions hope you find this useful and happy charting",59,36,1m3d8wr,2025-07-18T20:35:50,https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/1m3d8wr/i_tried_a_lot_of_ai_medical_scribes_so_you_dont/,,95,0.998,Positive,0.3648,Neutral,Healthcare

im a few years into practice in a surgical specialty here in canada while ive heard plenty of stories during training and from colleagues about difficult patient encounters i had been fortunate enough not to experience anything too extremeuntil now

i recently performed a minor procedure that by my recollection went fairly smoothly later that day the patient called my office and left a message stating that the procedure was quite uncomfortable that there hadnt been sufficient warning about how uncomfortable it might be and that new symptoms had developed prompting a request for advice

i returned the call the same day and started by apologizing for the discomfort this patient experienced i think my use of the word discomfort was a trigger and the patient immediately became very upset and launched into a monologue accusing me of not appreciating the level of pain caused calling me a bullshitter and hanging up before i could respond

i tried again about an hour later hoping the patient might be more receptive i started by acknowledging the pain this patient experienced but this only seemed to heighten the frustration the patient went on to say the office was inept called me a pathetic human being and threatened to leave a negative reviewthen hung up again before i could say anything further

fortunately my office was able to arrange a followup with one of my colleagues whos been given a heads up at this point it feels like a dead end trying to engage further the whole experience has been a real shock and im left feeling anxious and demoralized im not sure what to do at this point other than seeing if the inevitable complaint or bad review shows up",186,78,1m1vtdl,2025-07-17T02:25:59,https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/1m1vtdl/how_do_you_veterans_cope_with_not_feeling/,,264,-0.9935,Negative,0.81768,Positive,Healthcare

go watch the demo videos if you havent its crazy  i cant help but think that an emr that a tool like this could interact with easily would enable true automation and potentially in the near future  the focus could shift from ui based tools to make data entry and retrievalanalysis easier to a solid foundation that an ai agent could use easily  the user experience then could be primarily interacting with the data using natural language to establish preferences they are already so good at presenting data different ways and then an agent could write the note place the orders update the problem list the avs the whole thing  for sure the provider would need to review everything with a fine toothed comb but it really seems like true automation could be possible in the near future

its not just a hypothetical  their agent can read everything on a screen summarize what it sees click around write and follow customized instructions

to my knowledge they were the 1st system to implement this nationally and at first it was relatively reasonable

this post is somewhat a vent but just also just kind of looking for an outlet and possibly some guidance perhaps from perspective of new attending or more seasoned attendings

im a first gen doctor dont have any other doctors in the family or anyone to bounce off of for experience or guidance studied really hard in school was fortunate enough to get into a usmd program and graduated in 2023 now currently in a pediatrics residency at my home program

thankfully my program in not malignant and they seem to support me well im going into my 3rd and final year of residency

i just keep feeling this sense emptiness at times and somewhat some regrets my undergrad was very malignant and the professors were a bunch of jerks my med school i really just felt like a number wasnt a gem of the class tried my best while pretty much doing my whole residency transitioned after covid pandemic started beginning of school family went through some hardships during my time with school which correlated with covid and job insecurity but nobody really cared

i had actually matched into pediatrics which was not my first choice specialty but i always loved the pediatric patients and i have grown to be more fond of it and i really enjoy my patients

i guess what stirred me along in med school was that i was really seeking fulfillment while also achieving financial security in a time that that was very tough

i just dont have many people to look up to or ask for advice part of me is thinking that im almost done and i can get a job another part of me is saying perhaps you should do a fellowship or try and do another residency to increase your salary and fullfillment or achievement status i can go to more in detail in a dm but that is kind of where im at im a single man in my late 20s

there is no scientific justification for the use of azithromycin in the treatment of covid19 up to now pubmed

  
our findings are in line with available evidence that does not recommend the use of azithromycin as effective treatment for patients with sarscov2 infection and raise concern on risks associated with inappropriate use of this drug science direct

since bone marrow produces the immune cells theoretically replacing it should reset the immune system which should cure the disease because the new immune system lacks the faulty immune memory that drives the disease

1	collect autologous stem cells backup for gvhd disease
2	myeloablative conditioning destroy the patients existing bone marrow with chemo or radiation
3	infuse matched donor bone marrow
4	new healthy immune system develops
5	if gvhd happens reinfuse the patients original marrow to stop the complications

reddit,Aluminum-Adsorbed Vaccines and Chronic Diseases in Childhood: [No association with autoimmune diseases and decreased rates of autism and ADHD across all children born in Denmark from 1997-2018],"background

aluminum is used as an adjuvant in nonlive vaccines administered in early childhood concerns persist about potential associations between vaccination with aluminumadsorbed vaccines and increased risk for chronic autoimmunity atopy or allergy and neurodevelopmental disorders largescale safety data remain limited

objective

to assess the association between cumulative aluminum exposure from early childhood vaccination and risk for autoimmune atopic or allergic and neurodevelopmental disorders

design

a cohort study linking nationwide registry data on childhood vaccinations outcome diagnoses and potential confounders leveraging the variations in the aluminum content of childhood vaccines over time

setting

denmark 1997 to 2020

participants

1 224 176 children born in denmark between 1997 and 2018 who were alive and residing in the country at age 2 years

intervention

cumulative aluminum amount received per 1mg increase through vaccination during the first 2 years of life

measurements

incident events of 50 chronic disorders including autoimmune dermatologic endocrinologic hematologic gastrointestinal and rheumatic atopic or allergic asthma atopic dermatitis rhinoconjunctivitis and allergy and neurodevelopmental autism spectrum disorder and attention deficithyperactivity disorder

results

cumulative aluminum exposure from vaccination during the first 2 years of life was not associated with increased rates of any of the 50 disorders assessed for groups of combined outcomes adjusted hazard ratios per 1mg increase in aluminum exposure were 098 95 ci 094 to 102 for any autoimmune disorder 099 ci 098 to 101 for any atopic or allergic disorder and 093 ci 090 to 097 for any neurodevelopmental disorder for most individually analyzed outcomes the upper bounds of the 95 cis were incompatible with relative increases greater than 10 or 30

limitation

individual medical records were not reviewed

conclusion

this nationwide cohort study did not find evidence supporting an increased risk for autoimmune atopic or allergic or neurodevelopmental disorders associated with early childhood exposure to aluminumadsorbed vaccines for most outcomes the findings were inconsistent with moderate to large relative increases in risk although small relative effects particularly for some rarer disorders could not be statistically excluded

primary funding source

none





another large retrospective cohort including all children born in denmark from 1997 to 2018 who survived to age 2 without congenital anomalies or other major confounders to neurodevelopmental issues which actually found decreased autism and adhd risk 

another reminder that the aluminium exposure from foods and the soil are much more chronic exposures than that of the vaccine doses given",147,16,1m02mu9,2025-07-14T23:51:25,https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/1m02mu9/aluminumadsorbed_vaccines_and_chronic_diseases_in/,,163,-0.9335,Negative,-0.5286000000000001,Negative,Healthcare

reddit,I told the doctor my mom was lying about my symptoms,"15f 5 80lbs 

i posted here once before because i knew my mom was lying about me being sicker than i was and i wasnt sure how to handle it 
i took everyones advice and i ended up telling them at the next appointment after we checked in i said i had to go to the bathroom and i left a note with a nurse i think my doctor maybe looked at it before the appointment actually because it took a really long time for us to go back and then in the appointment the doctor was asking a lot more probing questions and clarifying questions and pointing out inconsistencies my mom said and then he asked to talk to me by myself and my mom by herself too actually 

so im seeing a a team of doctors now who wanted to verify some of the diagnosis that i had and they actually admitted me to do that like in the hospital and there was always a nurse or someone in my room with me 
im not 100 sure because no one actually told me this is why but im guessing it was to make sure my mom didnt say or do anything or give me anything is that something theyd actually do it sounds so dramatic or maybe its normal to check things out in the hospital like that idk 

anyway theyre changing some of my diagnoses now and my mom is talking with a counselor she still maintains thats shes not doing anything to me and im really sick and just getting influenced by crime documentaries but things are a little better shes not supposed to be in charge of any of my meds now i do that myself and i write down everything i take and when in a journal so theres a record and im not taking the hydroxychloroquine anymore

hi all

for the last 16 years ive done weird things in my sleep it started suddenly when i was 12 years old and has persisted ever since sometimes the things that happen during sleep really bother me and cause a great deal of distress other times they are mild and nothing more than a nuisance i always thought i was just weird and never looked into it that is until i was pregnant with my daughter in 2022 i used to jump out of bed and run this obviously became dangerous the more pregnant i got once i had my daughter i used to pick her up out of her bedside bassinet and run with her asleep out of the room very dangerous i still cringe 3 years later shes 25 now and last night she ended up in bed with me after a long night i had an episode where i jumped out of bed ran into the kitchen ran back grabbed her and picked her up ran back out of the room with her then i guess went back to bed and put her back in my bed all half asleep but awake enough to remember 

the symptoms of my sleep issues are

extremely vivid hallucinations that occur about 1030 minutes after falling asleep happen anywhere from multiple times a night to once or twice a week never during the day when im awake

sleep paralysis during naps really only occurs of i sleep on my back in a warm room during a nap usually not at night

confusional awakenings i wake up not able to speak and cant remember who i am who my husband is or where i am i just have a general sense of familiarity sometimes it can take awhile to snap out of it 

wake up and run out of the room from a dead sleep maybe from a hallucination that i dont remember

i am very fatigued all day every day no matter if i sleep 5 hours or 9 i used to self medicate with a stupid amount of coffee every day and naps i can not longer do this after the tachycardia diagnosis and a toddler if i push through the urge to go to sleep thag starts around 12 pm which is have to do everyday i get severe brain fog

my ist is so much worse at night because of the frequent sitting up or jumping up out of a dead sleep my heart rates can get up to 200 sometimes this has only been the last 3 years since covid

pertinent testing

i saw a sleep neurologist who suspected narcolepsy my mslt was negative for early sleep onset or rem even though i slept for all 5 naps my sleep latency during the nightime psg was 6 minutes on a prior psg my sleep latency was also 6 minutes and i had a rem onset of 50 minutes which she said was early once mslt was negative my sleep neurologist told me she didnt know and told me to come back if anything changes

i saw a neurologist who did a 5 day ambulatory home eeg which was negative for seizures but did capture quite a few of these episodes that the psgmslt did not 

mri head wwo normal 

if anyone can help me or give me advice id be so grateful i want another baby but im so scared that i could hurt them on accident i am scared for my current child my husband has a job where he is gone 3 weeks a month and i am all alone most nights its also so hard to function through the fatigue now without coffee and not being able to nap since my toddler dropped her nap",110,39,1m3imwj,2025-07-19T00:30:53,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/1m3imwj/think_im_a_danger_to_myself_and_my_daughter_while/,,149,-0.9959,Negative,0.372575,Neutral,Healthcare

a family member has presented with terrible indigestion for years and been prescribed omeprazole for about 15 years  with no further investigation in to cause 

in the last year she has had worsening pain in the oesophagus and stomach had bloods done in the last 12 months  inconclusive couldnt find anything specific

about 7 weeks ago the pain was worse and had yellow eyes and skin  went to emergency care and was fast tracked for investigation and results they did scans and blood work and she was told she had stage 4 pancreatic cancer with lung mets was told 6 months with treatment 

no treatment has been put in place yet still now 7 weeks later she had a stent fitted about 3 weeks ago then in the last 2 weeks she had a pet scan and eus they only prescribed enzymes after lots of pushing 

the consultant who did the eus last week seems to have taken her under his wing he has told her she does not have pancreatic cancer and doesnt know what the lungs marks are on the scans he has told her she is an enigma and he will get to the bottom of it 

at this point we dont even know who to believe anymore results are very conflicting 

she had a second stent which was fitted yesterday by the eus consultant she had problems with the first stent from 3 weeks ago and they hadnt done a brushing so the eus consultant did a new one yesterday

is this normal it seems fucking crazy negligent does anyone know what else it could be i have all the reports but cant upload them on here to share annoyingly 

no one has apologised no early care providers have reached out to discuss the stage 4 pancreatic cancer diagnosis change in prognosis were confused and angry

as i dont know my accurate weight ive put the approximate numbers

lately ive noticed that i feel the urge to drink water more often during the day than others and ive also been waking up at night so i could use the toilet and take another sip of water though id drunk it right before i went to bed 
if i dont do it i feel badly dehydrated it doesnt seem like i swell from such a lifestyle and ive no worrying symptoms apart from waking up at night too often even though it looks obvious that the reason i wake up at night is the water drunk right before bedtime even so it seems pretty weird to me how i almost regularly end up drinking 15l only in the morning while im still making myself breakfast 
if it may help clarify stuff anyhow heres some important detail about my diet which maybe explains my constant thirst i do not add salt no matter what food i eat it started when i once accidentally forgot to do that and found myself liking it this way way more than with any salt added i suppose it may have caused a lot of changes in the electrolyte balance however  i still regularly eat such food as bread where they add salt and im pretty much okay with that taste but not in case of such foods as meat fish and cereals

reddit,The r/climatechange Verified User Flair Program,"rclimatechange is a community centered around science and technology related to climate change as such it can be often be beneficial to distinguish educatedinformed opinions from general comments and verified user flairs are an easy way to accomplish this 

 do i qualify for a user flair

as is the case in almost any science related field a college degree or current pursuit of one is required to obtain a flair users in the community can apply for a flair by emailing redditclimatechangeflairgmailcommailtoredditclimatechangeflairgmailcom with information that corroborates the verification claim

the email must include

1 at least one of the following a verifiable edugovetc email address a picture of a diploma or business card a screenshot of course registration or other verifiable information
2 the reddit username stated in the email or shown in the photograph
3 the desired flair degree leveloccupation  degree area  additional info  see below

 what will the user flair say

in the verification email please specify the desired flair information a flair has the following form

username    degree leveloccupation  degree area  additional info

for example if reddit user jane has a phd in atmospheric science with a specialty in climate modeling jane can request

flair text phd  atmospheric science  climate modeling

if john works as an electrical engineer designing wind turbines he could request

flair text electrical engineer  wind turbines

other examples

flair text phd  marine science  marine microbiology
  
flair text grad student  geophysics  permafrost dynamics
  
flair text undergrad  physics  
  
flair text bs  computer science  risk estimates

note the information used to verify the flair claim does not have to corroborate the specific additional information but rather the broad degree area ie john above would only have to show he is an electrical engineer but not that he works specifically on wind turbines

 a note on information security

while it is encouraged that the verification email includes no sensitive information we recognize that this may not be easy or possible for each situation therefore the verification email is only accessible by a limited number of moderators and emails are deleted after verification is completed if you have any information security concerns please feel free to reach out to the mod team or refrain from the verification program entirely

 a note on the conduct of verified users

flaired users will be held to higher standards of conduct this includes both the technical information  provided to the community as well as the general conduct when interacting with other users the moderation team does hold the right to remove flairs at any time for any circumstance especially if the user does not adhere to the professionalism and courtesy expected of flaired users even if qualified you are not entitled to a user flair

south american highlands stay springlike all year round even under climate change unlike scandinavia or new zealand cities like medellín quito and cuenca are at high altitudes near the equator which means no extreme heat no frost

its also the only highland area in the world that have large modern cities with strong infrastructure and plenty of fresh water theres no risk of hurricanes or major wildfires either its stable

unlike lowland tropical zones or temperate regions facing extreme heat drought sea level rise or wildfires highaltitude equatorial cities like medellin cuenca quito or parts of the peruvian andes sit in the sweet spot

at over 1500 meters elevation south american highlands avoids both sweltering heat and frost its one of the few places where temperatures are projected to remain tolerable well past the 23c global threshold so im seriously considering moving there do you guys think this makes sense

ps im not sure why some people tend to make this assumption but just to be clear im not a doomsday prepper a survivalist trying to live offgrid or an environmental activist im simply a digital nomad traveling the world trying to find cities that will still be the most livable and stable in a climatechallenged future",32,201,1m2bt0y,2025-07-17T16:15:12,https://www.reddit.com/r/climatechange/comments/1m2bt0y/should_i_move_to_south_american_highlands_to_cope/,self,233,0.9555,Positive,0.27554,Neutral,Climate

reddit,"Can someone explain the whole ""Companies pollute, not people.""-thing?","i more frequently come upon the view mostly on reddit that you dont really have to worry or change your behaviour when talking about climate because it is the companies that pollute and not people and the whole c02 footprint was invented by the oil companies so people can just  for example keep flying because it is not their fault that the plane uses energy i have tried asking people what they and have not really gotten a full answear so i am asking here this is also a kind of a rant

  
i have a few points i am thinking about

 like if you purchase a new phone every year instead of trying to keep the old one working as long as possible would you not be responsible for releasing more c02 how is that the companies fault
 you want something but dont need it so you decide to not purchase it and therefore decreased the demand for the product and decreased production would you not have decreased the worlds output of c02
 you need some for example pants could be anything really clothing furniture housing food you get to pick between cheapsupermegatoxicplasticysweatshopwilldeterioratein3monthspants supersturdyecofriendlywilllastyearspants or cheap thrifted pants if you purchase the cheap crappy pants are you not responsible for what the companies are producing i know there is a thing here about personal economy here and not everyone can afford expensive good goods and that is understandable but thrifting also exists but also from my understanding things have never been cheaper someone please correct me on this i remember reading it somewhere like people are complaining about things being of bad quality yes what do you expect when you buy a pair of jeans for 20  in todays money clothing used to be an investment that you had to care of and mend could also be mended
 you want to travel from a to b you have two choices 1 train uses the lowest amount of energy 2 flying uses the most amount of energy you choose flying because it is more comfortable and cheaper and it is not your fault that it uses fossile fuel somehow and it is not your resposibility since it is the company that pollutes like i remember having an argument with someone online  about plane travel and they were saying that it doesnt matter since the plane would fly anyway with them on it or not does not basic supply and demand come in to this how also i have heard people saying it is ok to fly now because in the future there will be electric airplanes what
 you are having a meal you get to decide between burning rainforest steak or a vegan beandish you decide on the vegan dish today therefore decreasing your c02 output dramatically and decreasing the demand for burning down the rainforest and breeding more energyinefficient cows but this does not matter somehow

yes i understand the largest part of greenhouse gas emissions comes from electricity and heating but firstly would it not be a good thing to decrease the output from production and transportation still secondly you could decide on living somewhere more energy efficient an apartment is more efficient than a heating a whole house just for you andor your family also how does the whole companies pollute not people come in to play in terms of electricity and heating

however cisgender minors can still legally access some of the same medical treatments for example hormone therapy to address early puberty birth control or even surgical procedures like breast reduction these are not considered controversial or prohibited

the legal argument for the ban was that youth lack maturity to consent to permanent procedures but if that were applied universally wouldnt it also apply to the same procedures for cisgender youth

my question does this constitute a violation of equal protection principles de facto creating two different standards of care based on biological sex or gender identity

and more broadly are there legal or constitutional precedents where a law though neutral in wording was deemed discriminatory because of its practical impact on a protected group",32,151,1m2fx8s,2025-07-17T18:52:20,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/1m2fx8s/does_puerto_ricos_ban_on_genderaffirming_care_for/,,183,0.8589,Positive,0.24261999999999997,Neutral,Politics
reddit,"How has internet meme culture influenced U.S. political decision-making? (Immigration, Epstein files, and the concept of “meme logic”)","in recent years observers have noted a blurring of lines between internet meme culture and the political process meme logicthe idea that viral stories jokes and rumors from the internet increasingly shape realworld policy and discoursehas been cited by some analysts as a force behind major developments in us politics

for example viral claims and conspiracy theories about immigration have sometimes influenced public perception and arguably federal policysuch as the rise of narratives about certain immigrant groups or the proliferation of claims around temporary protected status tps similarly the ongoing discourse around the epstein files has sparked repeated demands for government action despite conflicting official statements

some point to this trend as evidence that political decisionmaking is becoming more reactive to viral internet narratives rather than grounded in traditional deliberation and factbased governance others argue that internetdriven activism and memesharing can serve as a democratizing force helping marginalized voices break through media gatekeeping

questions for discussion

 how significant is the influence of internet meme culture on actual political decisions in the us can you think of examples where a viral narrative appears to have shaped policy
 does the integration of meme logic into politics represent a breakdown of traditional governance or is it simply a new form of democratic engagement
 what are the potential benefits and dangers of political leaders responding to viral internet narratives

reddit,Is the entire immigration debate really just a problem with the American voter not wanting to deal with tradeoffs?,"ive been thinking about immigration and it appears to me that what americans want is a secure border which in this context means we know who is coming across the border and can keep tabs on it then seperately there is a question about how open the border should be on one side you have people like myself that think it should be easy for someone to come here and get a work permit and you have the stephen millers of the world that want our borders not just secured but closed then the third question becomes what do we do about internal enforcement and people who are already here on one side you have chaos is the point where the constant questioning of the rules and due process and hyper televised ice raids is actually deterring immigrants from trying to cross the border and is in effect securing the border the other side would rather see legal status solidified for a large chunk of those who have been here 20 years and dont have a criminal record border infractions are civil

  
the problem is it appears that americans dont want the chaos ice raids style enforcement which if that ends you will have more border pressure because more migrants would be willing to make the trek but they also dont want to make immigration so painless that people would rather go through the streamlined legal process which just means more illegal crossings

  
is this all just a problem of americans thrashing around because they dont want to deal with tradeoffs around immigration",86,225,1m1209z,2025-07-16T03:16:26,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/1m1209z/is_the_entire_immigration_debate_really_just_a/,,311,-0.6514,Negative,-0.26986,Neutral,Politics

trump has generally been immune to scandal but even mtg mike johnson and many of his supporters are up in arms now im wondering if the russian propaganda machine could be at least partly involved in pushing anger over the epstein files not being released

this situation reminds me of prime minister boris johnson in the uk who also seemed to be immune to scandal but then the ukraine war started johnson strongly supported ukraine and he was shortly brought down by a relatively quaint scandal he held a party during covid 

that seemed odd to me as well maybe im crazy but we do know russia puts a lot of resources into their propaganda machine including funding some right wing podcasters and plenty of republicans parrot russian propaganda how plausible is this connection

What is it about the list that is causing them to finally break from supporting him?,"in recent days some of magas more outspoken influencers are rushing to call out the trump administrations failure to release the unredacted epstein files a set of documents that detailed events organized by convicted predator michael epstein that according to his criminal case included sexual exploitation with numerous underage girls 

other influencers and appointees are defending the trump administration causing what appears to be a schism in the magasphere donald trump has posted several tweets and made comments in other venues that indicate he wishes this to go entirely away but instead the story seems to be gaining traction

why what about this event seems to be blowing up maga more than others are numerous media reports on the fraction exaggerated why did this trigger a schism when so many of trumps previous questionable actions have not will this go away or will it continue to build into a full split in the loose magasphere



for background in february 27 us dojs appointed head pam bondi officially released some of the information in the epstein files as a first phase and ordered more to be inspected for possible release further a press event was organized at the white house where 15 prominent rightwing influencers were given printed copies but the information they contained was already in the public space and there was an indication that more was coming

that information presumably including a celebrity list that many rightwing social media sources claimed contained the names of many democratic politicians was not released recently the doj and fbi jointly released questionably video footage of epsteins cell as evidence that epstein committed suicide and was not murdered and claimed that this celebrity list does not exist  this has infuriated fbi deputy director dan bongino who has accused fbi head bondi of overpromising and underdelivering on her interactions with this list and leading to some influencers calling loudly for it to be released while others defend trump",975,379,1lys6tq,2025-07-13T12:57:55,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/1lys6tq/donald_trumps_maga_seems_to_be_splitting_on_the/,,1354,-0.865,Negative,-0.011780000000000016,Neutral,Politics

in the immediate aftermath of the first rounds of chip export controls it was evident that they were having a number of effects the implementation of controls significantly disrupted chinas semiconductor ecosystem causing price spikes for some device types and forcing workforce reductions  
  
however as noted the restrictions also prompted china to implement an allout governmentbacked effort to improve the countrys selfsufficiency in all aspects of semiconductor design and production an effort that has already resulted in a number of startling achievements

reddit,"Does the Trump administration’s approach to immigration focus solely on enforcing laws against illegal immigration, or does it also reflect a broader stance that affects legal immigrants as well?","this is my answer to the question and why while the trump administration often says they will not tolerate mass illegal immigrationwhich is a valid concern especially for citizens living near the border who are most affectedtheir policies and actions reveal a broader antiimmigrant stance rather than just targeting illegal crossings

for example the administration deports people to countries they are not from sometimes even to different continents which raises serious humanitarian concerns conditions in detention centers remain largely unknown due to lack of transparency but released detainees report torture little sleep and inadequate food despite these harsh enforcement tactics the administration makes little effort to improve or streamline the path to citizenship instead the focus remains on deportations and border militarization

the administration also deports individuals who have valid visas or immigration protections granted by state or federal courtspeople who are legally in the country many who comply with immigration authorities in good faith seeking citizenship face deportation due to long inefficient and obstructive pathways

ices operations often resemble moblike raids without warning targeting both legal and illegal immigrants alike this creates an atmosphere of fear and sends a clear antiimmigrant message

media coverage of protests remains deeply polarized rightleaning outlets tend to highlight chaos and destruction in liberal cities portraying protesters as lawbreakers without showing their motivationswhich center on protesting inhumane deportations and racial alienation leftleaning media emphasize peaceful protest and the reasons behind them sometimes underplaying incidents of violence for example the no kings protest possibly the largest singleday demonstration in us history with millions participating peacefully demonstrates the widespread desire for immigration reform and justice

americans want a fair legal immigration system that upholds the rule of law without dehumanizing immigrants immigrants make america stronger and trump wants to get rid of that going back to the question does the trump administrations approach to immigration focus solely on enforcing laws against illegal immigration or does it also reflect a broader stance that affects legal immigrants as well",12,55,1lwogra,2025-07-10T21:15:00,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/1lwogra/does_the_trump_administrations_approach_to/,,67,0.7061,Positive,-0.24416,Neutral,Politics

undaunted the individual raised the leaf blower pointing the nozzle directly at the officers with a sudden burst of noise the leaf blower roared to life sending a powerful gust of air shooting out of the nozzle

the officers caught off guard stumbled backward as the blast of air struck them the individual seizing the opportunity charged forward leaf blower still blazing

the officers desperate to regain control of the situation reached for their pepper spray but the individual was relentless using the leaf blower to deflect the spray and send it back at the officers

as the standoff continued the individual began to gain ground slowly pushing the officers back with the force of the leaf blower the officers their eyes streaming from the pepper spray stumbled and fell giving the individual the upper hand

with a final burst of air the individual sent the officers tumbling to the ground their uniforms askew and their dignity bruised the individual triumphant stood over them leaf blower still clutched in their hand

for a moment the scene was frozen the only sound the hum of the leaf blower and the heavy breathing of the individual then with a sudden movement the individual turned and fled leaving the officers to pick themselves up and dust themselves off

as the individual disappeared into the distance the officers couldnt help but look at each other in amazement well that was a first one of them said shaking his head

the other officer nodded in agreement ive never seen anyone use a leaf blower as a weapon before

the first officer chuckled i guess you could say they really blew us away

the second officer groaned at the bad pun but couldnt help but laugh yeah i guess you could say that

as they stood there laughing and joking the individual watched from a distance a small smile on their face they had won the battle but they knew the war was far from over",0,0,1m3b0sp,2025-07-18T19:05:48,https://www.reddit.com/r/worldpolitics/comments/1m3b0sp/rise_up/,self,0,0.9805,Positive,0.0,Neutral,Politics

so heres the real deal if youre tired of the system running you into the ground its time to get off your couch and make your choices count stop mindlessly spending like its a hobby every dollar you dont hand over is a vote against the madness saving isnt just smart its a way to stand up without shouting so tighten those belts skip that impulse buy and show the economy that we call the shots now

its the interview with the founder of one of these autoapply tools if youre curious heres the link the tricky part is to understand if this creates even more inequality since people that can pay will be able to send more application but seems they solved the problem  
  
apparently they just made the whole thing free and companies are getting assaulted by candidates which i dont even know if its a good or bad thing for them since its free traffic but still

welcome to edmonds washington a bucolic town 30 minutes outside seattle very much like the kind our parents or grandparents might have grown up in edmonds is dead broke see link below  
  
things are so bad the city is planning to sell not only its frances anderson cultural center named in honor a deceased teacher but also the edmonds city hall itself and then evidently pay rent to the new owners you cant make up stuff this bizarre this is the reverse of a rent to own equity building program  
  
i usually blame politicians for this sort of financial disaster and certainly the edmonds village elders deserve a lot of blame but since being edmonds mayor or city councilperson there pays little to no salary its hard to imagine they were passing out voter freebies just to ensure their reelection  
  
possibly simple incompetence and the inability to say no to residents requests is the problem in a town like edmonds everybody knows everybody so if bob picks up the phone and asks for a new stoplight at his streetcorner its hard to push back your kids go to school with bobs kids or bob is the guy you used to mow lawns for 35 years ago these are nice folks and deserve a stoplight and a 10000 square foot culture and leisure center and a yearround 15 minute ferryboat to kingston which would take takes 2 and half hours to reach by car and an oceanfront city hall that view will help it sell quickly imho and 37 public schools which are not for sale at this time and 5 libraries and 3 firehouses and 65 full time police officers about the only thing edmonds doesnt have is its own municipal trash collection you must get your garbage picked up one of the 3 licensed private contractors  
  
edmonds spends 51 million a year to keep its residents happy think of this like running a restaurant with 51 million revenue and expenses which is losing money and customers edmonds population is declining and its average age is increasing now you can understand why the town is on the hook for 40 million in deferred and badly needed basic maintenance for its dining room and kitchen  er i mean public buildings all this is falling into the lap of mike rosen  a retired wildlife filmmaker  who is the newly elected restaurant managermayor  
  
can you see the problem here lack of credentials and financial acumen this is the inevitable outcome of elections which are popularity contests filled with promises on what will be bought or built next  
  
but before you cast shade on the voters and politicians in edmonds consider that this town is a microcosm of the entire usa we have 2 chambers of congress and a supreme court filled with people who have no credentials other than passing some states bar exam and a president who filed bankruptcy 3 times and then was convicted of loan fraud

they lived with a lot less median household incomes adjusted for cost of living were only around 2530k in 1955 compared to 82k today median home sizes were 970 square meet in 1958 today its 2400 square feet with less people per home  the ahs puts the median size of the existing us housing stock at 1790 square feet people mostly werent living in large suburban homes back then people still mostly lived in poorer urban areas and dilapidated rural towns the suburbs they did build were filled with homes that would be considered comically tiny and shoddily built by todays standards theres also a survival bias here the better built larger ones are the only ones which are still around the older ones are largely only still found in poorer areas 

food used to be 1620 of incomes and is as of 2024 10 clothing was around 8 and is today around 12 the images you see of women dressed very fancy that was not the norm this was the norm not because that was the style but because it was all people could afford items we take for granted were many times more expensive back then to the point where a huge portion of homes didnt even have them air conditioners washing machines dishwashers fridges tvs radios toaster ovens microwaves clothing irons etc 

college only 34 of americans in 1960 had a bachelors compared to nearly 40 today tuition was far less expensive but again people lived in poverty the vast majority of people couldnt take 4 years off and spend 6200 adjusted for inflation median tuition costs over 4 years to go to school you had to start working immediately there were no major government programs to help you out  
 

the big elephant in the room of course is housing costs ive already gone over housing sizes so ill skip that but housing is the one thing that has gone up even proportional to income  housing was 23 of peoples income in the 1950s and is today 28 the increase is not nearly as much as people think with the recent spike in prices partially because median incomes have risen so much and also because most people already are locked into their mortgages from years before 


however 23 of 30k is a much much bigger deal than 28 of 82k is  that means you have around 23k left over 28 of 82k means you have 59k left over",678,192,1m2hww6,2025-07-17T20:09:26,https://www.reddit.com/r/economy/comments/1m2hww6/middle_class_living_standards_in_the_1950s_would/,self,870,0.1955,Neutral,0.23156,Neutral,Economy

reddit,Annual PSA: Investing and Trading Scam Reminder,"for those new to reddit and to investing and trading  please be aware that social media platform like reddit discord etc can be a vector for scams and fraud 

offers to dm should be viewed as suspicious 

social media platforms continue to be a common method to recruit new investors to pigbuthering scams and pumpanddump scams  do not assume that an offer to help is legitimate

1 good explanation of pigbuthering here  pig butchering  how to spot
2 it is common for bots and malicious actors on discord to impersonate reddit and discord mods to distribute their scams it is possible to create a discord profile which appears similar to someone else
3 pump and dump of stocks are common on social media  bots or stock promoters who are seeking to profit from pumping a stock or to create hype you can sometimes identify if its a bot or promoter simply by looking at the posters comment and post history often you will see that the account has posted nothing related to investing or trading but suddenly there is the same or varying versions of comments on one or two specific stocks
4 one other way to recognize suspicious posts is if the op never engages in a discussion on comments and questions in the thread on their own dd those are all signs of stock promotion
5 offers to mirror trade and teach you how to trade are usually fake if you receive private solicitations to open accounts at a broker or investment adviser be wary

if you are in the us  you can always verify the legitimacy of a broker or investment adviser you can check the registration status of a broker at the finra web site here   you can check disclosures for investment advisers at the sec iapd web site here  

for those interested in understanding a little more about stock promoting and pumpanddumps  one of the mods provided an ama 15 years ago about a penny stock pump operation that he unwittingly became associated with  you can find the ama here",9,0,1m1llzv,2025-07-16T19:11:28,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1m1llzv/annual_psa_investing_and_trading_scam_reminder/,,9,-0.9004,Negative,0.0,Neutral,Economy

as the title says i ended up getting rid of my financial advisor which i had for four years i was getting charged quite a bit in fees seems like every 3 months i was being charged 150 to 180 for his services also he had me invested in multiple etfs which were not performing as well as i thought they would i was only up about 12 after 4 years on total gain  this is a roth ira btw

my question is  im trying to sell off all these bad performing etfs that he had me invested in and invest in basically a two to three fund etf portfolio 

so far i have bought since selling other etfs 80 in vti and 20 in fbtc

any reason to add a third etf 

also the best performing etf he had i kept so far is spyg which im up 35 in 4 years should i hang on to this or sell and buy more vti im 32 years old

reddit,Is Now a Good Time to Buy ASML After the Recent Dip,"hey everyone

ive been keeping a close eye on asml and i noticed the stock has recently pulled back from its highs given its critical role in the semiconductor industry being the only supplier of euv lithography machines used by tsmc intel and samsung im wondering if this dip presents a solid buying opportunity for longterm investors

asmls longterm fundamentals still seem strong

the global demand for advanced chips is expected to grow exponentially with ai data centers autonomous vehicles and highperformance computing

their tech moat is insane few if any competitors are close in terms of euv capabilities

margins and revenue growth have historically been impressive


however i also see some potential headwinds

global semiconductor demand cycles can be volatile

geopolitical tensions with china eg restrictions on chip exports could have ripple effects

the stock still isnt exactly cheap by traditional valuation metrics


im a longterm investor with a high risk tolerance and a multiyear time horizon im considering starting a position during this dip but would love to hear from others

are you buying the dip or staying on the sidelines

do you think current macro conditions interest rates geopolitical tensions make this too risky

is there a better entry point ahead

president donald trump is weighing an executive order which would allow 401k funds to make privatemarket investments in a huge shakeup to retirement packages

trump is expected to announce the new policy soon but precise details are being kept tightly under wraps and are still subject to change the wall street journal reported

the executive order is expected to instruct the labor department to begin working with the securities and exchange commission on guidance for employers and plan administrators

it would represent a huge victory for the private equity industry which has long been lobbying to gain access to workers 401k plans which currently is worth about 125 trillion

these portfolios have long been primarily comprised of stocks and bonds largely because they carry less risk than other forms of investment

private markets would give accountholders greater opportunity for growth and longterm rewards allowing investors to capitalize on private equity venture capital real estate and hedge funds which arent on public exchanges",2912,741,1m1vt52,2025-07-17T02:25:39,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1m1vt52/trump_to_open_401k_accounts_to_private_market/,,3653,0.9791,Positive,0.12069999999999999,Neutral,Economy
reddit,Beyond Defense: The REAL Innovation Play in Europe Needs a Speed Boost,"hey rinvesting and reurope

weve all seen the massive surge in defense stocks lately and for good reason but what about the other critical innovation sectors bubbling up in europe that could be huge longterm plays

im talking about areas like

electric vehicles evs  ev batteries europe is pushing hard to build its own ev champions and secure its battery supply chain were seeing more affordable models hitting the market and significant investment in gigafactories the competition with asian manufacturers is fierce but europes focus on sustainability and innovation eg in battery cell production emissions could be a differentiator

nextgen energy generation smrs small modular reactors are gaining serious traction as a clean reliable and scalable energy source the european industrial alliance on smrs is pushing for deployment by the early 2030s with significant government and industry support this is a massive market with global export potential

now heres the kicker what do all these cuttingedge sectors desperately need to succeed and gain a global competitive edge

they need to speed up research reduce lag time and slash development costs

think about it why build ten physical prototypes when you only need one or even better none to get to the optimal design the traditional rd cycle is slow expensive and resourceintensive

this is where companies like dassault systèmes come in

dassault systèmes through their 3dexperience platform is fundamentally changing how innovation happens they enable companies to create virtual twins  highly accurate digital models of products processes and even entire systems

imagine

virtually testing ev battery chemistries down to the molecular level without building countless physical cells

simulating the performance of a new smr design under extreme conditions before cutting any steel

optimizing manufacturing lines for evs or battery production in a digital environment catching errors before they cost millions

this kind of simulationdriven design and virtual prototyping allows for

massive cost reduction fewer physical prototypes mean less material waste and less manufacturing time

accelerated timetomarket iterating designs virtually is exponentially faster

enhanced innovation engineers can explore thousands of design variations and test radical ideas that would be too costly or risky in the physical world

improved product quality catching errors early leads to better more reliable products

so while defense is soaring keep an eye on these other european innovation sectors and consider the picks and shovels plays like dassault systèmes that are enabling this rapid technological advancement theyre not just selling software theyre selling speed and efficiency which are invaluable currencies in the race for future dominance",1,2,1m35933,2025-07-18T15:24:01,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1m35933/beyond_defense_the_real_innovation_play_in_europe/,,3,0.9974,Positive,0.5626500000000001,Positive,Economy

reddit,What if behaviour didn’t need to be managed?,"in schools behaviour is often managed in a variety of ways a common method is the use of a positive behaviour system which issues escalating corrections each time a student needs to be redirected another approach relies more on the teachers interpersonal skills using encouragement challenge or gentle coaxing to guide students towards behaviour that supports learning

there are other methods as well but i want to suggest that the very need to manage behaviour points to a deeper issue i believe this question brings it into focus do students possess more creativity and freedom than school allows

i believe the answer is yes and if that is true perhaps this is the root of many behavioural issues if students were genuinely free to explore what they enjoy and pursue learning without rigid limits perhaps behaviour would not need to be managed at all

i want to propose then that the solution to behaviour challenges lies not in more systems more emphasis on teacher skill or more sanctions it lies in rethinking the purpose of school itself the goal should be to unleash the potential of young people not to constrain it when students and adults are no longer positioned against one another something powerful might emerge",0,3,1m3m2aj,2025-07-19T03:24:43,https://www.reddit.com/r/education/comments/1m3m2aj/what_if_behaviour_didnt_need_to_be_managed/,self,3,0.9852,Positive,0.1709333333333333,Neutral,Education

reddit,How the Supreme Court Is Making Public Education Itself Unconstitutional,"on june 27 the supreme court released its decision in mahmoud v taylor the decision has not received the attention it merits a close reading of the conservative majoritys opinion suggests that the high court is moving toward determining that public schooling violates the first amendment of the constitution the decision could mean the end of public education in america

the author goes through the background and much of the public discussion around the case then points out that there is some language in the ruling that attacks public education more fundamentally

within the courts majority opinion however lies a deeper threat to the existence of public schools because the court determined that exposure to objectionable material violates parents rights policies involving that exposure are subject to strict scrutiny the highest standard of judicial review this level of judicial review requires that the government must demonstrate that the policy in question both serves an interest of the highest order and is narrowly tailored to achieve that interest

the supreme court would no doubt agree that an educated citizenry is a public interest of the highest order what the court does not address is whether public school systems are narrowly tailored to achieve the states goals

the author discusses the history of public education in the united states and then concludes  

all this history is at risk of being jettisoned instead the court has determined that the need to protect students from being exposed to ideas hostile to their familys religious beliefs trumps everything else under the courts new rules no curriculum could ever be constitutional unless parents are always informed in advance and can protect their children from anything objectionable to their specific religious beliefs

given this burden states may be forced to find a more narrowly tailored approach to educating citizens and before we know it one of americas greatest successes one of the most popular american institutions and one of the few we still share in common will be gone",511,105,1m1d9pj,2025-07-16T13:57:16,https://www.reddit.com/r/education/comments/1m1d9pj/how_the_supreme_court_is_making_public_education/,self,616,0.9384,Positive,0.29404,Neutral,Education

reddit,Trump Admin Cuts Funding For Public Schools. States Sue.,"thanks to the trump administration educators across the country suddenly dont know if theyll have the funds to support students and provide critical services on june 30 the department of education announced it was withholding nearly 7 billion from public schools in a threesentence email sent to the states the agency said it was reviewing five different funding grants some of the affected programs deal with support for english learners afterschool programs teacher professional development and adult education

the department remains committed to ensuring taxpayer resources are spent in accordance with the presidents priorities and the departments statutory responsibilities the email said

this week 24 states and washington dc responded to the freeze by filing a lawsuit against the trump administration alleging that the withholding of funds is illegal and would come at a great cost to students across the country in particular one group has found red states would be among the hardest hit 

it amazes me sometimes how much politicians like to hurt their constituents when you cut school funding staff and resources get cut with it this leads to larger class sizes and less support for the kids who need it the most but what can you expect from a draft dodging president who tells men they can grab women by the p and wants kids to grow up to be low iq drones plus a secretary of ed who never taught but oh yeah she helped run wwe wrestling so that qualifies them to make decisions about education 

lets be honest if these funds dont come in there may and will be some cuts to staff and resources once the school year has already begun i cant imagine telling a teacher or resources specialist that they just lost their job so trump can have a military parade on his birthday and remodel a used jet that he got as a gift",988,80,1m3cesn,2025-07-18T20:01:42,https://www.reddit.com/r/Teachers/comments/1m3cesn/trump_admin_cuts_funding_for_public_schools/,self,1068,0.9001,Positive,-0.36074,Neutral,Education

they are suppose to tell the center if their child has issues such as allergies diabetes autism etc 

i would find it odd for the parents to keep something like this a secret but i will talk with them next week









i know this is long sorry

68 year old group this kid has been that student if you know what i mean not a lot of trouble but loud and doesnt listen as well as the others

yesterday he was acting out a lot more than normal to the point where i had to step to the side and talk with him

as im talking to him he starts to become wobblywiggly once again you know what i mean hes 100 silent as im talking to him which isnt normal

he then proceeds to fall in me and starts to shake violently i would of still had this as normal weird behavior if it wasnt for the fact that hes barely balanced on me if i were of moved he would of fallen face first into the ground easily

i have epilepsy so seeing what i thought was a seizure was almost an out of body panic attack i was getting the parent over turns out to be the uncle so that could tell me something about the parents but i was just seeing myself having a seizure in my mind during this

the kid proceeds then to completely loose his mind crying screaming and running around the court as the uncle chases him the kid was just completely out of it and needed to sleep andor go home

the uncle eventually gets him but like the rest of this class i literally feel like im having a 30 minute panic attack

i cant say ive had a panic attack before so i have nothing to compare it to but this had to be it you can call me dramatic but the combination of my condition and how well he played the part it triggered emotions ive never truly felt

so i just hope that the uncle explains to the parents what he did i could talk with the parents but theres only two days left in camp and really isnt worth it for me

i just needed to vent that

  




if anyone is interested in what a panic attack feels like at least for me because it was actually interesting to me

vision blurs colors become muted hearing high pitch noise can still hear peoples voices though deeper breaths you feel like youre thinkingmoving in slow motion while everyone else is moving at a normal pace teaching literally goes into autopilot it was like i was witnessing myself teaching words were coming out and i was moving to students but i felt like i was barely in control

reddit,Feeding the Kids/Snacks in the Classroom,"genuine question heregiven the recent post to new teachers about not buying supplies for your own classroom

im going into my 3rd year in the classroom i teach high schoolers at a title 1 school in my area not everyone studentwise can afford things like snacks last year at each paycheck i paid for about 34 boxes of granola bars and 23 boxes of cheezits when i look back on the school year i realized that there were certainly a few kids who took advantage of the situation but for the most part the kids i gave the snacks to were ones who were affected by poor conditions at home

it was my philosophy going in that hungry students wont learn being that it was my first year at a new high school i guess i can chalk this up to datadriven results and see how it works this year the new variable is that ill have an intermediate course to teach which means that unlike a year of completely new students itll be half new and half returning

if i decide to track this ill probably just do that with the first years

that being said what are your thoughts regarding giving food in the classroom

edit a thousand heartfelt thanks for your responses to this there were a lot of great reasons both for and not for and i appreciate them all as such as much as i want to move forward with giving the students food in class ive got some solid reasons to put that endeavor aside and focus on other issues",72,191,1m37zjh,2025-07-18T17:09:18,https://www.reddit.com/r/Teachers/comments/1m37zjh/feeding_the_kidssnacks_in_the_classroom/,self,263,0.9449,Positive,0.09907999999999999,Neutral,Education

i am a sahm last year leading up to my oldest daughter entering school we ultimately decided to homeschool we are not happy with the schools in our district and i truthfully thought i was up for it my retired mother in law lives with us and was onboard to watch my other kids so i could do my daughters curriculum we were doing great even with an unplanned pregancy thrown in until around november of last year when my father who also lives with us was diagnosed with dementia and then shortly after had surgery that really fast tracked his dementia he went from being basically independent  aside from errand running  to completely incontinent and totally dependent on me i became his full time caregiver 
in a matter of weeks my life changed having to care for my dad in a way i didnt before ive done my absolute best to keep up with my daughters curriculum but i have so much on my plate and i know i havent done as good of a job as i could 
i say all of this to say that now we have decided to put her in public school at the start of this school year 
my dad is requiring much more help now and i know that if i continued homeschooling it would not be fair to my daughters as then i would have a kindergartener and first grader 
im very worried about my 65 year old she knows all of her letter sounds and weve already started on blending cvc words she has not had the easiest time with it and i ultimately am worried shell be behind should i call the school shell be attending ahead of time and discuss the situation will she be okay just knowing her letter sounds what can i do to prepare her what happens if she is behind

im a recent biology graduate that applied for phd programs in chemistry last fall i applied just for the experience of doing it because i was most certainly not going to get in i had the most minimal research experience and was applying for programs outside of the degree i actually got this was all before the parasite got his grubby hands all over scientific research so it ended up being the perfect storm for me to get 100 rejected this summer i have been working with one of my undergraduate professors doing research in organic chemistry and i absolutely love it i want so badly to keep doing research and pursue a graduate degree but with the way things are right now and how lacking my resume is i almost know i wont get in again so my new plan has been to apply for masters programs for 2026 this feels like the best option for me because it will give me more experience doing research and better qualify me for a phd that i dream of getting but i have some questions 

are schools that claim to offer ms programs likely to actually accept students for them and if so are they likely to continue accepting ms students given the way things have panned out in terms of research funding i know that masters programs are typically selffunded but i still have to wonder if this will affect how manyhow likely universities will be willing to take students

how long is a typical ms program for chemistry i hear that a phd is 57 years which does admittedly feel like a big commitment to me at the moment and if a masters is shorter that will certainly be a better fit for me 

is anyone else taking this route for science in particular due to funding circumstances id love to know that im not alone in feeling this way

i just had to add to the ai conversation today based on something that happened recently a researcher my organization contracted with had a grad student write part of a report for us and i was the one to edit and review it there were very obvious signs of ai to those who keep up with technology in some sections the first sign was em dashes a questionable sign so i brushed it off the second sign was weird citations citing a journal or publisher eg nature 2024 rather than authors i then checked the nonparentheticals to match and the articles did not exist

i was not aware that a grad student had been recruited to help so i assumed our organization was potentially being overcharged for an expert report i could do myself with chatgpt this could have resulted in funding getting pulled for next year if i hadnt reached out and gotten clarity which is part of my job but not everyone does their job thoroughly and could have left a bad taste in our mouth about the researcher 

some industries are small and word of mouth travels fast if you have to use ai only do it if youre willing and able to check the accuracy of it especially citations because thats one of the only obvious signs these days making bad ai products may not be a victimless crime  you may cast a bad light on the pi or lab which can impact funding but if these citations had been properly formatted i may not have even noticed it since the citations had reasonable titles and lists of authors that included wellknown names in the industry which is kind of nervewracking to me as an editor",529,76,1m2aqop,2025-07-17T15:35:01,https://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/1m2aqop/as_someone_from_industry_be_careful_with_using_ai/,self,605,-0.9685,Negative,-0.01831999999999999,Neutral,Education

reddit,I have provided my defense committee a version of my final report and I have not gotten any feedback.,"hey guys so when i did my thesis defense with the way things worked out my committee decided to give me some time to work on my report even though i passed my thesis defense presentation

they gave me some deadlines that were kinda at a longer timeline that i wanted to graduate but they said if i can get the report done earlier then there is no reason why i couldnt graduate at an earlier date

i have shared the document a little over a week ago and no one has provided feedback at this point my thoughts are if no one is saying anything even after viewing the document then why cant i just get cleared to graduate

there are a lot of personal external factors at the moment have me wanting to graduate as soon as possible",0,1,1m2yktk,2025-07-18T10:19:05,https://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/1m2yktk/i_have_provided_my_defense_committee_a_version_of/,self,1,-0.4939,Neutral,0.8908,Positive,Education
reddit,applying to post-baccs even with significant research experience?,"ok im about to sound real dumb here but just bear with me im a new grad with plans of pursuing a phd and i just need some clarification on a few things i dont think i quite understand what the difference is between a postbacc and just a regular ra research position which one looks better for phd apps are postbaccs specifically designed for new graduates who dont already have substantial research experience and if so does that possibly mean an applicant who does will have a lower chance of being admitted

the way that one of my friends who actually also just graduated with me and is doing her phd in the fall sort of talked down on post baccs i dont remember exactly what she said but the jist of it was yeah most people who get into phds have to do a postbacc before but i got in right out of college yeah shes not exactly the most humble lol but is what shes implying true is there a stigma around doing one",0,6,1m2y5sy,2025-07-18T09:53:52,https://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/1m2y5sy/applying_to_postbaccs_even_with_significant/,self,6,0.9651,Positive,0.7575,Positive,Education
reddit,Please do not wait until you defend your dissertation to begin applying for academic jobs,"just a few caveats before i begin this post is specific to us academia yes i know the job market is a nightmare and yes there are basically no jobs im speaking as a thirdyear tt professor in the humanities at an r1 who survived three cycles in the job market at the high of covid and who has served on multiple hiring committees and of course im speaking generally ymmv so do your own research 

ive now encountered several grad students at conferences online etc who were told by their advisors not to apply for academic jobs and postdocs until they defended their dissertation this is insane advice and im not sure where it comes from from what ive observed the advisors giving this advice tended to be more senior folks who are out of touch with the realities of academic hiring

waiting like this meant that many did not start applying until late marchearly april when academic hiring in the us is mostly done this left them high and dry immediately post graduation and many did not understand what had gone wrong so im saying this to you all now

grad students do not wait until you have defended you dissertation to begin applying for academic jobs and post docs many of you will apply in your last year of your program assuming a typical schedule of submitting the dissertation in the spring the time to start looking and applying is in the fall before you defend and graduate

and yes i know there are concerns that abd job candidates might not be finished with the dissertation by the time a position starts but its still wrong to tell students especially ones with a high probability of completing the dissertation that they should wait until the spring of the final year to apply to academic jobs

reddit,Should I switch my Masters degree to get more funding?,"i am about to start a thesisbased masters degree in september i found a supervisor whose work im really interested in and my supervisors lab enables me to do an msc in either neuroscience or biomedical engineering initially i was pretty certain that i wanted to do an msc in neuroscience while my supervisor and i were chatting about the application she asked if i was sure about doing neuro i said yes but decided to take another look at courses  the only difference between the two degrees is the 34 courses i am required to take through the course of the degree we had a brief conversation about funding prior to me looking at bme courses and i was informed that it would be 30kyear 

i later decided to do bme because i preferred the courses that were offered as the neuroscience ones were kind of a repeat of my undergrad and they seemed more useful careerwise my supervisor gave me the ok and i applied

when i got my acceptance i received my funding information and turns out the funding for an msc in bme is only 23k this was totally my fault for not double checking beforehand but now im regretting my decision  yes the classes in bme were more interesting but im not sure its worth the financial difference for me receiving a 30k stipend would make a huge difference and would prevent me from having to get another job outside of my program 

additionally im seriously considering switching into a phd when i can the funding for a phd in bme is the same as an msc 23k while the funding for a phd in neuroscience is 40k receiving 40kyear across the duration of a phd is monumental for me compared to 23k in the same timeframe in neuroscience i most likely wouldnt need another part time job and i could 100 focus on my studies instead

im seriously regretting my choices and i feel like an idiot for not double checking the funding information  i was under the impression that it would be the same across degrees 

my question is is it worth it for me to try to switch into an msc in neuroscience at this point considering the above does it make me look really bad disorganized and greedy to my new supervisor if i try to do this the process to switch looks pretty straightforward all id need to change otherwise is the courses im taking and my project wouldnt change at all",4,1,1m2l31z,2025-07-17T22:15:42,https://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/1m2l31z/should_i_switch_my_masters_degree_to_get_more/,self,5,0.6916,Positive,0.2411,Neutral,Education

i want to eventually transfer to another online mlis program however im wondering if its worth it when the field is in peril where i live i live in louisiana and our governor put a hiring freeze on libraries l interviewed for a library tech position back in may and it took them until late june to send me a letter and say i didnt get the job

i feel at a loss i want to finish my degree since i already started however i fear that because of whos in office along with other issues the library field has become a dying one and i dont want to spend more money just to not get hired should i find another school or should i just accept its not a good time to pursue this field

for a bit of background i have two bachelors degrees in sociology and english i made the mistake of not working in a library before starting my mlis but i have a lot of experience in research because i interned as a mcnair scholar during undergrad and have given presentations at various universities i want to one day work in an academic library setting",3,0,1m2dypp,2025-07-17T17:37:57,https://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/1m2dypp/mlis_studentsgraduates_is_it_worth_continuing_my/,self,3,-0.7385,Negative,0.0,Neutral,Education

ive completed 2 semesters thus far but had to take a break from school in my 3rd semester to go to rehab but now i dont want to go back to grad school for a profession ive realized i have no interest in truly being in but being exposed to many forms of psychotherapy in my personal life and in rehab ive realized that i would really love to pursue this field however im not sure if i should stay with the program since i have 3 more semesters to go or to go ahead and make the switch which would entail applying to psychcounseling grad programs and working a fieldadjacent job in the meantime but breaking this news to my parents would be very difficult given all the time money and energy spent in my slp grad school program already

reddit,I tried to blow the whistle that parts of the Orion were not properly designed 15 years ago. One of those systems was this side hatch that is still failing. A story about how this happened and how other problems likely exist on the Orion.,"tldr 

 i worked on this side hatch 15 years ago 
 the design of that system and others on orion was totally fraudulent and everyone knew it 
 that system is still causing problems today 
 lockheed and nasa knew about it and chose to squash dissent rather than address the issues 

in 2008 i was hired as an engineer to work on the orion vehicle specifically i was hired as a subcontractor to work on the cias  crew impact attenuation system my subcontractor was ghg

immediately i saw problems the orion had just gone through pdr  preliminary design review yet no one could produce a single piece of mathematics to explain how they got from nothing to the existing cad model there was an fea analysis presented as part of the pdr but no one besides me had any knowledge of fea no one could tell me where that analysis came from

within a few weeks i was approached by another engineer and told that he and i were swapping jobs it was explained to me by him and my manager  kurt miller  that he could not do his job and that he had asked for my position as he and that group lead were friends this was presented as if i could refuse but i would not  because of the implications

my new system was the asds  abort system to docking system it was a one man team and the two previous engineers had both refused to do any work citing a lack of training knowledge and mentorship it had measurements and analysis that were presented in pdr but none had any mathematical support whatsoever they seemed to be made up completely  again

i spent the next year doing a full mathematical design i received no mentorship no help no guidance and not a single question i asked about the process was answered i was always told that we were all learning as we went on

i worked 60 hours a week and when i finished i was told to move into testing again i asked for guidance and was told none existed i was also told to relax for a while years while the remaining systems caught up i asked to be transferred back to my original role or to another position

at this time my yearly review came up i filled out my forms and submitted them to ghg the process should have been that my manager at lm talked with me about the review and then we would agree on the results instead ghg called me over and showed me the review i got 55 marks for pretty much everything  including behavior however there were 3 sentences at the bottom comments section claiming i had a bad attitude

my subcontractor  ghg  told me that my manager claimed to have spoken with me i assured them this was not the case and they immediately refused to speak with me any more kurt miller denied making the comments or submitting the review ghg then claimed that he had reasserted both those things eventually i asked that everyone get in the same room

when the day of the meeting came ghg no showed kurt miller was sitting behind his desk and another manager  kim kuykendall  was present she managed the hatched and latches  including the side hatch that is still causing problems

she explained to me that the negative comments were not in the review and that i was being transferred to her group to work on a test fixture for this side hatch she refused to speak about anything else kurt refused to say anything and instead placed his head on his hands and then rolled back from his desk and placed his head under his desk ghg refused to speak with me and i refused to sign the review

this is the united states space program and these are two non technical engineers with decades of experience

upon getting to my new group i was brought to a room in the basement where a door from a previous program sat  i believe it was gemini i was told that the engineers had copied this design and enlarged it to fit orion specs

here was the problem  orion was much larger and the seal had to be a lot denser because it would be in space longer and could not leak air like gemini these two things meant that the mechanism to open and close the door would not work properly again this was a known issue that i was able to deduce within hours

when i raised this issue and asked how i could design a test fixture when the design of the actual door was going to change i was told that if i needed the design of the hatch  latch to be complete to do the test fixture then this was my job to complete it basically i was told to do their work  again

i politely stated that i would not without being given the role and credit for doing it at this point everyone stopped working with me

i was eventually tasked with writing test software with labview my thesis work was in labview and i was very proficient in it a trial license was put on a computer in a locked training room in the basement and i was told to work on the software when the room was available  after hours

again this is the us space program

not long after the hatches group was brought to a room where our managers  kin kuykendall and paige carr  told us that the design was now considered a failure and we were going to have to start over they made it clear that heads would roll they stated that if you felt that you were responsible and wanted to make a case for remaining you should come talk to them so  walk in and admit that you deserve to be fired and beg to remain i didnt actually work on the design so i wasnt concerned

again this is the us space program

a few days later i was terminated

lockheed and nasa maintain several unwritten policies that apply only to unprotected classes of people one of those is that employees that do not produce for six months can be terminated that means that you can get a review where you are a 55 top performing engineer and then 6 months and 1 day later be terminated with no discussion you wont even know what allegations are made against you much less be given a chance to defend yourself you are just escorted from the building since this takes place in texas and the people have no protection status they have no grounds to sue

i was terminated 6 months and 1 day after moving to the hatches group  six months and 1 day after getting the 55 review

i filed a nasa oig complaint denoting that the three systems i saw  including the side hatch  all had zero mathematical basis for their design and everything else listed above to my surprise i was told that nothing i alleged was denied apparently there was no legal issue with what was done as long as lockheed and nasa didnt lie to the oig

i was never given a reason for my termination i filed a lockheed ethics complaint and was literally laughed at and told that the filing of the complaint established a record of having a bad attitude i was told through the grapevine that i was blamed for the failure the side hatch design basically lockheed tells nasa that the design failed and they fired the guy responsible that destroyed any chance i had at a career anywhere else

the problem is that the remaining people could not do the design initially and they didnt suddenly become competent when i was terminated thus these failures 15 years ago bleed into today because incompetent engineers remain in place

nasa was 100 aware of this because they acknowledged it in my oig complaint 

these issues were known and lockheed and nasa made the conscious decision to terminate an employee with a history of doing things other engineers could not and retain ones that failed repeatedly there were reasons for this based on contractor vs subcontractor and protected vs unprotected classes

i left a lot out for brevity  although i failed at that i have no solutions and ive spent an unfortunate amount of time trying to get nasa and lockheed to do something about these designs theyve spent 30 billion and 20 years on this",1817,168,1m1ga7n,2025-07-16T15:51:51,https://spacenews.com/nasa-studying-issues-with-orion-hatch-design/,default,1985,-0.9983,Negative,-0.017619999999999997,Neutral,Space

reddit,Do you think the vast majority of alien life in the universe lives in icy exoplanets and ice shell moons ?,"this is more of an opinionated discussion about how likely do you think it is that the ice shell moons in the solar system harbor life

there is only 1 earth in our solar system and the habitable zone of temperature for surface water is pretty thin compared to the rest of the solar system but we have many examples of ice moons with some decent evidence of global oceans or pockets of liquid water under the hard icy crust such as triton europa enceladus titan ganymede callisto titania etc and then other bodies have evidence of past oceans which have since frozen over like miranda pluto and ceres pluto is interesting because its moon charon also has evidence of a frozen ocean and itself could inject enough gravitational tidal forces to warm pluto and help maintian a subsurface ocean considering how new and geologically active plutos surface looks despite its tiny size 

if these worlds indeed have nutritious liquid oceans then surely even known extremophiles on earth could survive there let alone alien life that could have evolved there",0,32,1m2vglt,2025-07-18T06:58:48,https://www.reddit.com/r/space/comments/1m2vglt/do_you_think_the_vast_majority_of_alien_life_in/,self,32,0.959,Positive,-0.0455,Neutral,Space

1 flight 10 b16 and an unknown ship probably s37 likely set back at least a month or two due to s36 exploding during prop load for a static fire test on june 18th 2025 b16s successful static fire elon estimate 3 weeks as of 14 july 2025 or 4 august 2025
1 ift9 b14s35 launch completed on 27 may 2025 this was booster 14s second flight and it mostly performed well until it exploded when the engines were lit for the landing burn spacex were intentionally pushing it a lot harder this time ship s35 made it to seco but experienced multiple leaks eventually resulting in loss of attitude control that caused it to tumble wildly so the engine relight test was cancelled prior to this the payload bay door wouldnt open so the dummy starlinks couldnt be deployed the ship eventually reentered but was in the wrong orientation causing the loss of the ship restreamed video of spacexs live stream
1 ift8 b15s34 launch completed on march 6th 2025 booster b15 was successfully caught but the ship s34 experienced engine losses and loss of attitude control about 30 seconds before planned engines cutoff later it exploded restreamed video of spacexs live stream spacex summarized the launch on their web site more details in the rspacex launch thread
1 ift7 b14s33 launch completed on 16 january 2025 booster caught successfully but starship experienced a rapid unscheduled disassembly during its ascent burn its debris field was seen reentering over turks and caicos spacex published a root cause analysis in its ift7 report on 24 february identifying the source as an oxygen leak in the attic an unpressurized area between the lox tank and the aft heatshield caused by harmonic vibration
1 ift6 b13s31 launch completed on 19 november 2024 three of four stated launch objectives met raptor restart in vacuum successful starship reentry with steeper angle of attack and daylight starship water landing booster soft landed in gulf after catch called off during descent  a spacex update stated that automated health checks of critical hardware on the launch and catch tower triggered an abort of the catch attempt
1 goals for 2025 first version 3 vehicle launch at the end of the year ship catch hoped to happen in several months propellant transfer test between two ships is now hoped to happen in 2026
1 currently approved maximum launches 10 between 07032024 and 06032025 a maximum of five overpressure events from starship intact impact and up to a total of five reentry debris or soft water landings in the indian ocean within a year of nmfs provided concurrence published on march 7 2024

reddit,"Call to Action (Again!): Americans, Call Your Senators on the Appropriations Committee","good news for the astronomy research community 

the senate appropriations subcommittee on commerce justice science and related agencies proposed a bipartisan bill on july 9th 2025 to continue the nsf and nasa funding this bill goes against trumps proposed budget cuts which would devastate astronomy and astrophysics research in the us and globally

you can read more about the proposed bill in this article senate spending panel would rescue nsf and nasa science funding by jeffrey mervis in science   
and this article us senators poised to reject trumps proposed massive science cuts by 		dan garisto  alexandra witze in nature  


note that this is not related to the big beautiful bill which passed last week you can read about the difference between these budget bills in this article by colin hamill with the american astronomical society  
 

so what happens next  
the proposed bill needs to pass the full senate appropriations committee and will then be voted on in the senate and then the house the bill is currently awaiting approval in the appropriations committee

call your representative on the senate appropriations committee and urge them to support funding for the nsf and nasa this is particularly important if you have a republican senator on the committee if you live in maine kentucky south carolina alaska kansas north dakota arkansas west virginia louisiana mississippi tennessee alabama oklahoma nebraska or south dakota call your republican representative on the appropriations committee and urge them to support science research

these are the current members of the appropriation committee  


you can find their office numbers using this link  


when and if this passes the appropriations committee we will need to continue calling our representatives and voice our support as it goes to vote in the senate and the house

inb4 spacex and blue origin can do research more efficiently than nsf or nasa  
spacex and blue origin do space travel not astronomy or astrophysics while space travel is an interesting field it is completely unrelated to astronomy research these companies will never tell us why space is expanding or how star clusters form or how our galaxy evolved over time astronomy is not profitable so privatized companies dont do astronomy research if we want to learn more about space we must continue government funding of astronomy research",25,2,1lxe2ze,2025-07-11T18:12:43,https://www.reddit.com/r/Astronomy/comments/1lxe2ze/call_to_action_again_americans_call_your_senators/,self,27,0.9647,Positive,0.9634,Positive,Space
reddit,Read the rules sub before posting!,"hi all

friendly mod warning here in rastronomy somewhere around 70 of posts get removed yeah thats a lot all because people havent bothered reading the rules or bothering to understand what words mean so here were going to dive into them a bit further

the most commonly violated rules are as follows

pictures

our rule regarding pictures has three parts if your post has been removed for violating our rules regarding pictures we recommend considering the following in the following order

1 all picturesvideos must be original content

if you took the picture or did substantial processing of publicly available data this counts if not its going to be removed

2 you must have the acquisitionprocessing information 

this needs to be somewhere easy for the mods to verify this means it can either be in the post body or a top level comment responses to someone elses comment in your link to your instagram page etc do not count

3 images must be exceptional quality 

there are certain things that will immediately disqualify an image

 poor or inconsistent focus
 chromatic aberration
 field rotation
 low signaltonoise ratio

however beyond that we cannot give further clarification on what will or will not meet this criteria for several reasons

1 technology is rapidly changing
2 our standards are based on what has been submitted recently eg if were getting a ton of moon pictures because its a supermoon the standards go up to prevent the sub from being spammed
3 listing the criteria encourages people to try to game the system

so yes this portion is inherently subjective and at the end of the day the mods are the ones that decide 

if your post was removed you are welcome to ask for clarification if you do not receive a response it is likely because your post violated part 1 or 2 of the three requirements which are sufficiently selfexplanatory as to not warrant a response

if you are informed that your post was removed because of image quality arguing about the quality will not be successful in particular there are a few arguments that are false or otherwise trite which we simply wont tolerate these include

 you let that image that i think isnt as good stay up 
    as stated above the standard is constantly in flux furthermore the mods are the ones that decide were not interested in your opinions on which is better
 pictures have to be nasa quality 
    no they dont
 you have to have thousands of dollars of equipment
    no you dont there are frequent examples of excellent astrophotos which are taken with budget equipment practice and technique make all the difference
 this is a really good photo given my equipment
    just because you took an ok picture with a potato of a setup doesnt make it exceptional while cell phones have been improving just because your phone has an astrophotography mode and can make out some nebulosity doesnt make it good phones frequently have a halo effect near the center of the image that will immediately disqualify such images

using the above arguments will not wow mods into suddenly approving your image and will result in a ban

again asking for clarification is fine but trying to argue with the mods using bad arguments isnt going to fly

lastly it should be noted that we do allow astroart in this sub obviously it wont have acquisition information but the content must still be original and mods get the final say on whether on the quality although were generally fairly generous on this

questions

this rule basically means you need to do your own research before posting

 if we look at a post and immediately have to question whether or not you did a google search your post will get removed
 if your post is asking for generic or basic information your post will get removed
    hint theres an entire suggested reading list already available here
 if your post is using basic terms incorrectly because you havent bothered to understand what the words youre using mean your post will get removed
 if youre asking a question based on a basic misunderstanding of the science your post will get removed
 if youre asking a complicated question with a specific answer but didnt give the necessary information to be able to answer the question because you havent even figured out what the parameters necessary to approach the question are your post will get removed

to prevent your post from being removed tell us specifically what youve tried just saying i googled it doesnt cut it 

 what search terms did you use 
 in what way do the results of your search fail to answer your question
 what did you understand from what you found and need further clarification on that you were unable to find

as with the rules regarding pictures the mods are the arbiters of how difficult questions are to answer if youre not happy about that and want to complain that another question was allowed to stand then we will invite you to post elsewhere with an immediate and permanent ban

object id

wed estimate that only 12 of all posts asking for help identifying an object actually follow our rules resources are available in the rule relating to this if you havent consulted the flowchart and used the resources in the stickied comment your post is getting removed seriously use stellarium its free it will very quickly tell you if that shiny thing is a planet which is probably the most common answer the second most common answer is starlink thats 95 of the id posts right there that didnt need to be a post

do note that many of the phone apps in which you point your phone to the sky and it shows you what you are looing at are extremely poor at accurately determining where youre pointing furthermore the scale is rarely correct as such this method is not considered a sufficient attempt at understanding on your part and you will need to apply some spatial reasoning to your attempt

pseudoscience

the mod team of rastronomy has several mods with degrees in the field were very familiar with what is and is not pseudoscience in the field and we take a hard line against pseudoscience promoting it is an immediate ban  furthermore we do not allow the entertaining of pseudoscience by trying to figure out how to debate it even if youre trying to take the proscience side trying to debate pseudoscience legitimizes it as such posts that entertain pseudoscience in any manner will be removed

outlandish hypotheticals

this is a subset of the rule regarding pseudoscience and doesnt come up all that often but when it does it usually takes the form of x does not work according to physics how can i make it work or if i ignore part of physics how does physics work

sometimes the first part of this isnt explicitly stated or even understood in which case see our rule regarding poorly researched posts by the poster but such questions are inherently nonsensical and will be removed

bans

we almost never ban anyone for a first offense unless your post history makes it clear youre a spammer troll crackpot etc rather mods have tools in which to apply removal reasons which will send a message to the user letting them know which rule was violated because these rules and in turn the messages can cover a range of issues you may need to actually consider which part of the rule your post violated the mods are not here to read to you

if you dont and continue breaking the rules well often respond with a temporary ban

in many cases were happy to remove bans if you message the mods politely acknowledging the violation but that almost never happens which brings us to the last thing we want to discuss

behavior

weve had a lot of people breaking rules and then getting rude when their posts are removed or they get bans even temporary thats a violation of our rules regarding behavior and is a quick way to get permabanned to be clear breaking this rule anywhere on the sub will be a violation of the rules and dealt with accordingly but breaking this rule when in full view of the mods by doing it in the modmail will 100 get you caught so just dont do it

claiming the mods are power tripping or other insults when you violated the rules isnt going to help your case it will get your muted for the maximum duration allowable and reported to the reddit admins

and no your misinterpretations of the rules or saying it was generating discussion arent going to help either

while these are the most commonly violated rules they are not the only rules so make sure you read all of the rules",861,0,fq44oo,2020-03-27T19:46:14,https://www.reddit.com/r/Astronomy/comments/fq44oo/read_the_rules_sub_before_posting/,self,861,-0.9979,Negative,0.0,Neutral,Space

reddit,Saturn over the years,"note the change in the orientation of saturn and its rings since i first captured it four years ago

like all planets saturn has a titled axis of
rotationbut not all planetary tilts are the same 

in one half of saturns year it seems to angle toward the sun and illuminate the top of the rings the other half of its year it appears to angle away from the sun thus illuminating the bottom of the rings of coursethere is no up and down in space

twice during saturns year which is 30 earth years long the sun aligns with the planets equator this is called an equinox causing the rings to seemingly disappear because they are edge on that was late marchwe missed it but heyit happens twiceasaturnyear so 15 years from now mark your calendars for 2040

fun factid be a little over two years old on saturn no dice not doing high school again but waitits day is only 10 earth hours long so

reddit,Meet ‘Ammonite’ — A New World Just Found In The Solar System,"an object has been discovered orbiting the sun far beyond pluto calling into question theories about a possible planet nine in the solar system

the object for now designated 2023 kq14 and nicknamed ammonite was found by astronomers in japan using its subaru telescope in hawaii announced in a paper published today in nature astronomy the object is not a planet but a sednoid its only the fourth sednoid ever discovered


ammonite 2023 kq14 what is a sednoid
a sednoid is an object beyond the orbit of neptune that has a highly eccentric orbit similar to that of the dwarf planet sedna one of the most distant objects in the solar system known to astronomers


astronomers use the distance between the earth and the sun  one astronomical unit or au  to measure distance in the solar system sedna gets as close to the sun as about 76 au but as far away as 900 au on its elliptical orbit 2023 kq14 gets as close as 66 au from the sun and as far away as 252 au


ammonite 2023 kq14 and the planet nine hypothesis
there has been a lot of attention among astronomers on planet nine in recent months in may scientists in taiwan looking for a ninth planet in the solar system found hints in archive images in june a study by rice university and the planetary science institute put a number on the chances that a ninth planet exists  40

i apolgize if this comes off as a make the decision for me but even after talking to some people who are enlisted recruiters and friends its a mixed bag of it gave me purpose and dont because itll change you and who you are as a person 

the being away from family part doesnt bother me because frankly thats why i was moving but will i miss doing the regular things i do now like chilling out when im off or playing games on my pc 

or do you kind of learn to love being busy all the time 

thank you for your thoughts and ill try to answer questions if any i guess to put an end to this should i try a bit longer say till im 26 and then ask myself if im happy where im at or just dive in now while i am a bit younger and ranking up will be a bit faster age wise",1,10,1m3d84g,2025-07-18T20:34:57,https://www.reddit.com/r/Military/comments/1m3d84g/looking_for_advice/,self,11,0.9854,Positive,0.10970000000000002,Neutral,Defense

reddit,[Rant] Bradley Cooper Gave a Better Performance Than Any Nominee and Emmy Voters Ignored It Because It Wasn't About Showbiz,"just watched the civil warset season opener of the righteous gemstones final season im baffled and stunned at the fact that bradley cooper didnt receive a nomination for outstanding guest actor in a comedy what are we even doing anymore

one of the best actors of his generation shows up in a comedy in a oneoff role playing elijah gemstone as a drifting con artist who murders a pastor and steals his identity to become a chaplain and somehow someway turns that madness into a touching nuanced and legitimately spiritual arc you watch this character go from manipulative dirtbag to a man who finds real purpose and comfort in giving dying soldiers hope that final payer before the mass execution gutpunch chills and it all feels earned

but nope no nom why because its the righteous gemstones and not the bear or only murders in the building or whatever hollywood darling happens to be namedropping stage plays and chainsmoking

the real kicker five out of six nominees in the guest actor in a comedy series category went to the studio a show literally about show business you cant make this up its like theyre parodying themselves now

hollywood fall over themselves for anything thats meta or about showbiz look he plays a director whos sad how brave meanwhile cooper crushes a oneepisode role in a southern televangelist satire and gets nothing why because his character finds faith instead of crying in a craft services trailer

now i hate the people who scream woke at every turn but for realhollywood doesnt help itself when it snubs a performance just because it carries even a flicker of spiritual redemption that makes it way too easy for the all the badfaith culture warriors to score points

and to be clear the righteous gemstones is far from a conservative or rightwing show its a chaotic black satire but i guess having the audacity to show a character grow spiritually was enough to turn off the voters thats just sad

bradley freaking cooper got snubbed for actual acting in a comedy that dared to show a character becoming better it was brilliant it deserved more",29,35,1m3klhv,2025-07-19T02:08:34,https://www.reddit.com/r/television/comments/1m3klhv/rant_bradley_cooper_gave_a_better_performance/,spoiler,64,-0.6193,Negative,0.21708,Neutral,Media

reddit,Australian Activist group's 'Collective Shout' significant involvement in the push for age verification,"hi not sure if this is the right sub to post this on but im sure a lot of you are familiar with the ongoing controversy this activist group had with steam as of recently where they convinced payment providers such as visa and mastercard to force steam into banning specific pornographic games that included the themes of child rape and incest however i came across interesting info about them 

i managed to find that this group was specifically involved in the proposal of age verification systems in both australia and in the uk expressing their full support of the age check certification scheme which was approved by the uk government they once proposed a letter to the australian government back in 2019 to introduce age verification on all pornographic sites but the federal government did not act upon it in september 19th 2023 they reiterated another letter proposing the same idea recommending that the esafety commissioner should lead in the development of this rule



by attempting to initiate a movement to enforce this bill in the commonwealth they have been collaborating and supporting ncose which have been the american group convincing states like texas to implement age verification on all pornographic sites

they also have been involved in other censorshiprelated causes in the past such as

forcing australian retailers such as target and kmart to remove grand theft auto v from their shelves



rallying a petition to remove detroit become human as it contained themes of child abuse and violence against women their twitter post has since been deleted but has been archived



forcing the australian government to revoke tyler the creators visa to perform his tour in australia back in 2015 due to lyrics involving extreme violence against women





tried calling on immigration to deny snoop doggs visa of performing in australia also as of 20142015



called on immigration to revoke eminems visa of performing in australia around the 20142015 period



lobbying against corporate advertisers in australia to take down ads deemed sexually explicit



some of their calls to action directly violate the freedom of creative expression and just looks like they are wanting to censor games with even a slither of sexual violence in it

reddit,Kiss cam privacy,"regarding the recent incident at the coldplay concert i am curious how this works from a legal perspective when i bought tickets for a concert i was never faced with a question regarding permission to be filmed and published maybe it works differently in the eu though or maybe ive been living under a rock and never noticed



edit

i am leaving the original post above that i consider a fairly spontaneous question for those reading the thread

i could have been more detailed in my post and i think it is my fault for not spending an extra minute rewording the text that i wrote a bit hastily i will avoid responding to individual comments since it seems clear to me by now how offtopic they are and focused only on what happened at the coldplay concert and not on my question about the consequences of using the kiss cam

the comments i read often inappropriate some really aggressive and often out of place are mainly focused on the act filmed that of the couples hypothetical cheating of which i omitted in my initial post because in my opinion that is not the point of my question

instead my question was aimed precisely at the act of filming and amplifying behavior in a public place i believe there is a fundamental ethical fallacy in the kiss cam that lies in the staggering asymmetry between its mundane purpose that of entertaining the public and its potentially catastrophic consequences

a moment of entertainment such as that of a concert a game or other event can become a burden for an unexplicitly consenting participant

this imbalance calls for a fundamental rethinking of legal standards and these kinds of practices at events

thank you to all the responses that prompted me to continue my research and on which i hope to be able to better file and refine my thinking

best



edit 2

im rereading some of the comments and the total lack of empathy for what happened baffles and concerns me
it is one thing to attend a public event in a crowd it is another to identify and zoom in on two specific people out of context
the voluntary kisscam managed by the cameraman the subsequent highlighted shot by another bystander the ease and detail with which faces are highlighted the online manhunt to identify the two victims identify them and denigrate them publicly on the internet with a tamtam amplified by socials

but do you really not grasp the danger of this



edit 3

double standards

i read peoples comments saying since youre in a public place dont expect privacy i know and i agree as a general rule of common sense

but is a stadium or rather a private place that is hosting thousands of people who must pay a ticket to gain access still considered a public place should it be subject to the same rules as a street or a public park accessible to all

out of curiosity i wondered if the same applies in reverse if they filmed the coldplay concert and uploaded it to social media what would happen if its public then whats the problem

i searched and read the first results link and i am even more confused than before why is it that to film the concert i have to have written permission and to film two random poor people in the audience and use that recording to do the show is okay

the more i reflect the more i am convinced that this whole things is not balanced and to the disadvantage of the audience not the organizers",510,310,1m2w9ai,2025-07-18T07:50:05,https://www.reddit.com/r/privacy/comments/1m2w9ai/kiss_cam_privacy/,,820,0.8728,Positive,0.05324000000000001,Neutral,Privacy

at that point there i decided it was time to change how interact online  i started with a change from gmail to proton  aliases for different sets of accounts and throwaway aliases for anything i could not care about then just whittled down my gmail by closing accounts and right to delete my personal data

i then opted for a password manager and a yubikey which i use for 2fa and hardware security keys  social media i gave less permissions for access  and for my android phone i use a proton email

the thing is i still want to share stories on social media with family i tried signal but getting others to adopt for me has been near impossible  i went to librewolf browser but having to log into everything is sometimes a real pain and simply wanting to be suggested a youtube video to pass sometime i actually miss  i avoided using ai platforms for ages but copilot and gemini are extremely useful  i would say duck and go search is amazing very happy with that over google

reddit,Why the Data Broker Industry Should Be Banned to Protect Public Safety and National Security,"the data broker industry which involves the collection aggregation and sale of personal information from various sources poses significant risks to public safety and national security these companies often operate with minimal oversight and their data is easily exploited for criminal activities and espionage leading to severe consequences

data brokers enable criminals by providing detailed profiles that can be exploited for identity theft fraud stalking and blackmail criminals can purchase sensitive information such as addresses financial details and personal habits making illicit activities easier and more targeted in 2019 law enforcement agencies uncovered that cybercriminals used data purchased from brokers to identify and target victims for scams including sim swapping attacks that resulted in financial theft and account takeovers

the lack of transparency and regulation allows data brokers to collect vast amounts of data without individuals informed consent this erosion of privacy can lead to misuse of information discrimination and suppression of free speech which destabilizes societal trust and civil liberties foreign intelligence agencies and malicious actors can exploit data broker databases to conduct espionage influence operations or target key individuals in 2018 researchers discovered that a usbased data broker sold detailed property records including owner information to foreign entities such data could be used for reconnaissance by foreign spies to identify potential targets or gather intelligence on critical infrastructure

data brokers have been implicated in enabling surveillance by authoritarian regimes and malicious actors the extensive profiles compiled can be used to monitor dissidents political opponents or vulnerable populations during the hong kong protests in 2019 activists reported that private data from brokers was used to identify and target protesters leading to arrests and intimidation

the industry operates largely unregulated with no comprehensive safeguards to prevent misuse this absence of oversight makes it difficult to hold companies accountable for data breaches or malicious use amplifying risks to public safety and national security given the extensive potential for misuse criminal activity and espionage facilitated by the data broker industry a complete ban with high criminal and civil penalties for violations is justified removing this unregulated conduit for personal information would significantly enhance public safety protect citizens privacy and bolster national security against malicious exploitation",258,13,1m1wkve,2025-07-17T03:04:04,https://www.reddit.com/r/privacy/comments/1m1wkve/why_the_data_broker_industry_should_be_banned_to/,,271,-0.9807,Negative,0.22388000000000002,Neutral,Privacy

reddit,Automated Function ID Database Generation in Ghidra on Windows,"been working with function id databases lately to speed up re work on windows binaries  especially ones that are statically linked and stripped for those unfamiliar its basically a way to match known function implementations in binaries by comparing their signatures not just hashes  real structuralfunction data if youve ever wasted hours trying to identify common library functions manually this is a solid shortcut

a lot of windows binaries pull in statically linked libraries which means youre left with a big mess of unnamed functions no dll imports no symbols  just a pile of code blobs if you know what library the code came from say some open source lib you can build a function id database from it and then apply it to the stripped binary the result tons of autolabeled functions that wouldve otherwise taken forever to identify

whats nice is that this approach works fine on windows and i ended up putting together a few powershell scripts to handle batch id generation and matching its not a silver bullet compiler optimisations still get in the way but it saves a ridiculous amount of time when it works",13,2,1m254kt,2025-07-17T11:32:21,https://blog.mantrainfosec.com/blog/17/automated-function-id-database-generation-in-ghidra-on-windows,,15,-0.5859,Negative,0.4753,Neutral,Privacy

reddit,A New Era. Why r/PTIO Is Now A Restricted Sub.,"first and above all i personally and sincerely want to thank uburunghantu for his originally creating the privacytools website and this subreddit and for inviting me to be one of the mods here six years ago

his efforts to raise privacy consciousness and evaluating the tools to achieve this is an amazing legacy that he and we should commend

______________

you may have noticed that rprivacytoolsio has been changed to a restricted subreddit and no longer allows general posts  comments

some may see this as a drastic step we hope everyone understands that the former privacytools team  ie the current privacyguides team  has enjoyed our shared journey over the years we want every one of you to be part of our future travels just as our site has transitioned to a new home we sincerely hope all you join us at rprivacyguides

the growth of this sub was the result of great effort across several years by the privacyguidesorg team and by every one of you

a subreddit is a great deal of work to administer and moderate like a garden it requires patient tending and daily care its not a task for dilettantes or commitmentchallenged people it cant thrive under a gardener who abandons it for several years then shows up demanding this years harvest as their tribute its unfair to the team formed years ago its unfair to you

ive enjoyed  and am proud of  being a moderator of rprivacytoolsio ive had help  ublacklight447ptio uerktheerk and many others but moderating this site has been largely done by myself especially these past four years as it experienced most of its growth

as we announced first three months ago and again a month ago our mission  providing the best source of reliable unbiased and nonselfinterested advice to restore your online privacy  was being negatively impacted by longstanding problems established in our founding that could no longer be mitigated

rprivacyguides now exists as the reddit home for privacyguidesorg recently privacytoolsio was reverted to a personal site we feel it engages in practices violating our norms ensuring reliability being unbiased and not engaging in selfinterested practices this split and what role rprivacytoolsio has given this recent change has generated confusion here weve received supportive comments weve been asked why we havent yet ripped the bandaid off weve been asked when will we complete the migration we promised

weve already done this for our site we are now doing this for this subreddit

we really value the community weve built here all of you

we really hope you continue our shared journey

please join us over at rprivacyguides and at privacyguidesorg",582,1,qk7qrj,2021-11-01T06:04:14,https://www.reddit.com/r/privacytoolsIO/comments/qk7qrj/a_new_era_why_rptio_is_now_a_restricted_sub/,self,583,0.9914,Positive,0.0,Neutral,Privacy

follow up question in a situation where you verify with both an smsphone verification and later use an authenticatortotp if you lose access to the phone number you used for the sms verification will the siteservice be fine with that and simply allow you to fall back on your authenticatortotp 2fa code thingy assuming the siteservice lets you use both and not just one or the other

reddit,Looking for active missleading Adblocking and anti/fake-fingerprinting tool,"hello

ive been playing with an idea for a more aggressive antitracking and adblocking tool that would not only block adds and trackers which is something that can be kind of used to fingerprint and track you but instead actively work to misslead and harm the fingerprinting process by feeding it false data

its still only a vague concept and i suppose someone else has already come up with something like this if someone knows about a project like this id love to see it and contribute if its opensource

so what exactly i have in mind a tool that would run in backgroundin a browser and not only work as an adblocker but actively render and click on all the adds in background if im not mistaken you payget money for clicks per add right so autoclicking is against tos and can hurt the advertisers and will probably get your ip banned which is a plus it would also constantly search for various unrelated topics click on links chat with botsother fake profiles this may be taking it to extremes and basically run a fake selenium in background that would try to appear as a real user that does random stuff and is trackable which should make it impossible to distill the real you from all the data which will in turn make it worthless 

does it make sense the idea is to not only passively defend against fingerpringing but actively and maliciously fight back  have something like this been made is it a idea that could be worth pursing and developing i have to admit that i dont know much about how fingerprinting exactly works so are there any serious pitfalls or holes in the plan that could make it unfeasible what do you think about it its mostly a brainstorm right now would anyone be interrested in developing an app like this

reddit,Are custom roms overrated(except calyx and graphene),in privacy focused forums you often hear the benefits of custom roms like lineage os e os etc but these roms lack verified boot which is a clear security problem even though it might not affect most people the question so becomes is it worth it for most people to use these roms another possible solution i dont see people talking about is just using the stock rom that comes with your phone but removing all gapps and other services by using adb you can basically remove all apps you dont want like gapps system apps and just download foss alternative im not a security expert but i think its a better strategy than using roms that dont have verified boot but if someone more knowledgeable than me knows some reason why its not a good idea pls point it our in comments,11,7,qi5l7d,2021-10-29T05:29:15,https://www.reddit.com/r/privacytoolsIO/comments/qi5l7d/are_custom_roms_overratedexcept_calyx_and_graphene/,self,18,0.6473,Positive,0.4622,Neutral,Privacy

reddit,Immigration and Customs Enforcement Investigation/Search Megathread,"over the past few weeks we have seen an uptick in posts asking about what individuals can or cannot do if immigration and customs enforcement ice or other law enforcement officers ask to enter a business or home looking for illegal immigrants so we are making this centralized post to provide an overview of what individuals rights are in these situations we will be locking all posts that ask questions which are covered by this post

first it should be stated that everyone who is physically present in the united states is protected by the fourth and fifth amendments to the united states constitution these rights are not dependent on citizenship or being lawfully permitted to be in the country this means two critically important things first no one is required to speak with law enforcement or any government official second with some exceptions discussed below no one can be detained or searched without probable cause this also means that generally law enforcement cannot enter a home or space that is not open to the public without a judicial warrant although again some exceptions are discussed below

another important thing to remember is that not all law enforcement officers are ice in fact the vast majority of law enforcement that the average citizen will encounter are state or local officials you should always verify claims of ice being in x area and should avoid spreading rumors or speculation

searchesseizures

this is a highly complex area of law so there is no simple bright line rule that can be applied however provided law enforcement has probable cause most searches and seizures would be permissible moreover in general the remedy to an unreasonable search or seizure is that the evidence obtained is suppressed furthermore it is typically criminal to interfere with or obstruct lawful actions of law enforcement as such while you should know and assert your rights if law enforcement continues to states they will conduct a search or attempts to detain you as a practical matter you should assert that you object to the search or detention but should not physically interfere and should assert your rights in court so lets dig into the details a little more


the fourth amendment states that 
the right of the people to be secure in their persons houses papers and effects against unreasonable searches and seizures shall not be violated and no warrants shall issue but upon probable cause supported by oath or affirmation and particularly describing the place to be searched and the persons or things to be seized

notice the amendment does not state that a search requires a warrant rather it states that the people shall not be subject to unreasonable searches or seizures and that warrants shall only be issued upon probable cause the supreme court has held that this means a warrant is preferable and is required when practicable but that there are a host of situations in which a search or seizure would be reasonable even absent a warrant a duly issued judicial warrant also means that a search of the place identified for the person or things identified is presumptively reasonable

first in public short detentions are permissible in instances where law enforcement can articulate a reasonable suspicion of criminal activity that reasonable suspicion must be based on specific articulable facts not mere hunches or guesses so for example if a robbery occurred two blocks from where you are stopped while wearing a grey hoodie and jeans and the suspect at the bank was described as wearing a grey hoodie and jeans it would be reasonable to detain you to determine if you were the suspect in question that said even under those circumstances you would not be required to answer any questions beyond identifying yourself

if during the course of the stop described above the officer developed probable cause to believe you were in fact the bank robber then you could be searched and arrested for the crime probable cause is a fairly low standard though it is satisfied when a reasonably prudent person based on facts known to them at the time would warrant the conclusion that a crime was or has been committed 

however under the same general set of facts just described if you were at home at the time the officer first spoke to you unless the officer had seen you commit the crime and followed to your house then you could not be arrested in the home the home is considered a sacrosanct place under the fourth amendment as such absent observation of an ongoing crime or where law enforcement is in hot pursuit of an individual that has been observed by the officer committing a crime a warrant or consent is always required to search a private residence

another notable exception to these rules is that within 100 miles of the border customs and boarder patrol may stop and board vehicles and vessels and search for people without immigration documentation if the initial stop in this situation is an established checkpoint then the stop does not even require reasonable suspicion of a crime a roving cbp patrol does require reasonable suspicion for the stop though in either case your right to remain silent under the fifth amendment remains in place and a search of your person or personal effects would require probable cause

when law enforcement seeks to enter a nonpublic place other than a home they must have 1 probable cause based on facts they have personally observed 2 a judicial warrant or 3 consent of the property owner or an authorized representative in this context the difference between a judicial warrant and an administrative warrant is key a judicial warrant is issued by a court in the context of federal officials investigating immigration issues it would be a federal court although a state court could also issue warrants to state law enforcement an administrative warrant is issued by an immigration officer or immigration judge judicial warrants may authorize entry into nonpublic spaces administrative warrants can not authorize entry into nonpublic areas they simply authorize detentionarrest of an individual if that person is found in a publicly accessible space however as stated above if you have stated your objection to officials entering a space because they only have an administrative warrant and they nevertheless attempt to make entry you should simply restate your objection but should not resist or obstruct them

it is critically important that you not interfere with or obstruct any law enforcement officer carrying out a search as interference with a legal search is criminal in its own right 18 usc chapter 73 contains various provisions making it a crime to obstruct federal or state officials in carrying out their duties state law will also generally make it criminal to prevent law enforcement from carrying out their duties as such if you have stated your objection to officials entering a space conducting a search or detaining anyone you should not thereafter make efforts to impede the law enforcement officer from conducting that action

right to remain silent

the fifth amendment protects everyone in the united states citizens and noncitizens alike from being forced to incriminate themselves the fifth amendment states no person  shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself this means that with limited exception no one is compelled to speak with law enforcement however should you elect to remain silent you may be subject to additional detentionquestioning in addition if called to testify in a civil or criminal proceeding regarding another individual a court may reasonably determine that you do not have any reasonable ground to believe your testimony would be selfincriminating and can compel you to testify

in addition there are some situations outside of a judicial proceeding where you may be required to provide basic information to law enforcement first if the police have reasonable suspicion that you have committed a crime you may be required to identify yourself in addition depending on your immigration status there are some instances where lawful residents of the united states who are not citizens are required by the terms of their admission to identify themselves and provide documentation of their legal status this does not mean that all individuals are require to produce evidence of lawful status it simply means that there are some programs permitting lawful presence in the united states that require individuals who are a part of those program to identify themselves

right to inform others of their rights

you may always inform others of their legal rights the first amendment to the united states constitution protects your legal right to tell anyone citizen or not that they have legal rights this includes those who are being detained by law enforcement although you must maintain a reasonable distance from the law enforcement officers so as to no interfere with their actions as such you may tell anyone citizen or not that they do not have to speak with the police and you may tell anyone citizen or not that they do not have to consent to a search such statements are not criminal even if they are addressed to individuals who are in the country unlawfully however you should be aware that 18 usc  1324 does make it a crime to among other things intentionally conceal someone that you know or have reckless disregard for the knowledge is in the country illegally

right to record law enforcement

the first amendment to the united states constitution protects your legal right citizen or not to record law enforcement in public spaces you do not have to be a member of the press or have any relationship to the individuals you are recording to do so if you are in a space you are legally permitted to be in you cannot be legally detained simply because you are recording something which law enforcement doesnt want on camera",19,17,1lboh53,2025-06-15T01:27:54,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/1lboh53/immigration_and_customs_enforcement/,,36,-0.9979,Negative,-0.27644,Neutral,Law
reddit,Read before commenting: Off-topic and anecdotal comments are not allowed and subject you to a permanent ban,"greetings from the mods

weve had a flood of offtopic comments recently  were posting this to remind everyone that offtopic and anecdotal comments are not allowed  an offtopic comment may subject you to a permanent ban  

the rule

commenting rule 1 comments should contain a legal answer or a strongly related nonlegal answer if it is not legal advice do not post period you will be banned

what is offtopic

any response that doesnt answer the question by reference to legal information or principles  a joke a wisecrack a comment about ops formatting use the report button instead are all offtopic offtopic also includes expressions of sympathy opinions on the law and comments that berate the op or anyone else   

incidentally simply adding get a lawyer to an offtopic comment does not make it ontopic  and get a lawyer on its own without further information or help is considered unhelpful and may be removed on that basis

if you want to discuss a post then wait until it hits rbestoflegaladvice or ask a question about the subject of the post in rlegaladviceofftopic  the main subreddit and a comment thread are never a place to have a philosophical discussion about the law or the post  it is a place to answer the questions asked

what is an anecdote

for our purposes anecdotes are stories about something that happened to you or someone you know or heard about who may have had something that might be similar that happen to them

these comments are not helpful  they do not include current legal information that is relevant to the op and therefore they are offtopic  if you know the answer to the question based on current law and relevant jurisdiction then just answer the question without the story

another type of anecdote is i dont know the law in the jurisdiction you actually asked about but in some other state the law is  that is just not helpful  laws are different in different places  these types of answers are offtopic

referring an op to a thread on a different subreddit or to somewhere else on the internet because it might include a similar situation is anecdotal advice and not allowed 

these are not the only types of anecdotes but they are probably the most common ones  again if you are not referencing legal information or principles your comment is probably not allowed

violations subject the user to an immediate and permanent ban

not that we need to justify enforcing our rules but this is a busy subreddit and the mods have a lot to do  if a user shows up here doesnt read the rules and posts a single offtopic comment the user may be immediately and permanently banned  

this policy is not intended to be punitive although we know it may seem to be  there are a lot of you and not many of us and banning users that do not follow the rules even once is in the best interests of the subreddit  violating the rules almost always means the user didnt bother to read them and we simply dont have time to deal with such users  

tldr  unless you have a legal answer do not reply to any post in this subreddit  you may be permanently banned even for a first offense",166,0,1jc4909,2025-03-15T20:23:33,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/1jc4909/read_before_commenting_offtopic_and_anecdotal/,,166,-0.8994,Negative,0.0,Neutral,Law
reddit,Boss keeps all our tips and says they “go back into the company” or are used for our Christmas bonus. Is this legal?,"location virginia

i work at a small business with two locations about 20 employees total we receive customer tips both in cash and on credit card transactions but none of the employees ever actually receive them

when asked the manager at one location says the tips go back into the company a coworker spoke with a manager at the other location and she said that the last time she asked the owner claimed the tips are saved up and used to fund our christmas bonuses last year each of us got 100

that 100 was nowhere near what any of us should have received if all the tips from the year were actually being pooled and redistributed we have no written policy no transparency and were not part of a tip pool or service charge system we also have no way of knowing how much is being collected from customers on our behalf

when my coworker texted our hr person asking about how tips were distributed she was left on read

from what ive read under federal law and maybe state law too tips are supposed to belong to the employees who earn them not the company

my questions
		is it legal for the business to withhold 100 of our tips and reroute them into company funds or bonuses
		what are my rights under federal and virginia law
		would i be protected from retaliation if i filed a complaint

thanks in advance for any advice

reddit,"Would a ""Calming Space"" in a closet be a reason for CPS to make a case against me?","greetings everyone 

location california

so recently my wife changed a general purpose storage closet into a calming closet for our kids before this closet was used to store large toys board games and just general household things that might have been used maybe one or twice a month 

i cleaned out a closet in the downstairs bedroom currently the office so we were able to move most of the large items into there while donating the rest with all that free space my wife thought it would be nice if the kids had an area to decompresscalm down and started working on it its also worth mentioning that my kids have been having some issues with their tempers hence the reason to convert the closet into a calming area we thought itd be good for the kids so in the event that they get over stimulated or are just having a hard time they could go in there and use a child locklocated on the inside to take a break from everyone it decorated with posters that are explanative of emotions soft toys and things that are able to hold their attention that are not tech related

so my issue begins when my father saw it and flipped out threatening to call cps on us for locking our kids in the closet as a punishment for the record the kids are always welcome to use it when they want time to themselves and at our recommendation when theyre having a hard time regulating their emotions it has not been used as a form of punishment

the thought of having cps called is quite worrisome but my question is would this situation be reason for concern

the closet is well illuminated surrounded by soft toys and stimulation toysitems and posters that are suppose to help with calming but considering it is a closet im not sure if it would be a cause for concern

their family gave us a couple thousand for the down payment and i wouldnt have qualified for the mortgage without their income as soon as we moved in they quit their job every mortgage payment has come from my personal account

to my understanding all was well  they even asked when i called to find out their eta to the courthouse clerk was asking where they were about the money id agreed to give them in the separation agreement in the courtroom they gave the judge a note and a psychology letter stating they were emotionally distressed and physically disabled and unable to pay for a lawyer and they wanted 7 of the homes total value in monthly installments over 5 years it would be close to 14k i dont even have that much equity in the house for some reason they brought three people to the hearing i provided the required witness

the judge refused to proceed and sent us to mediation ex got pretty upset on hearing we would have to pay 5050 for it and they would likely not be able to bring someone with them 

they had months to talk to me about the agreement ive been very reasonable and understanding i also found out they did not file a financial declaration which they are required to do it seems crazy to me and i dont understand why they would talk to me about sending them the money agreed on in the separation agreement right before court then insist in court that they were too emotionally distressed to understand the same agreement it seemed like they expected the judge to read their letter and shred the separation agreement or something

i want information on what mediation looks like and if their demand is likely to be upheld is the idea that we reach a new agreement and go back for a regular hearing what if they wont back down on this ive been told i should go in insisting we keep the original agreement amended that they pay me back for my half of the mediation is it time to get an attorney",55,12,1m3gwxs,2025-07-18T23:10:54,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/1m3gwxs/at_divorce_hearing_ex_claimed_they_were/,,67,0.9738,Positive,0.51222,Positive,Law

hi all this happened last weekend i was racing in a triathlon on saturday morning and was leading the race in the bike portion following the race designated lead motorcycle 

with about a mile before the end of the bike segment a race volunteer watched the lead motorcycle go by and decided to cross the road between the moto and myself while crossing she looked the other direction realized that other bikes were heading out on the course still and tried to double back i had made an attempt to avoid her by going to the left  but when she doubled back i was pinched between the shoulder of the road and her and we collided i crashed over the handlebars and my bike was significantly damaged i did a quick evaluation of myself asked if the volunteer was okay which she said she was and got the bike into rideable order before hopping on and finishing out the race this all happened very quickly as my bike computer shows i was going 242 mph at the time i start slowing and 0mph 2 seconds later 

after the race i spoke with the race director and a second race organizer separately at their designated info tent after the race one came and looked at my damaged bike with me both gave me the impression that they thought it should be covered under their race insurance and that they would reach out to me on monday after contacting them the second individual also told me he thought i should get my bike to my local bike shop for a full detailed estimate and told me outright that they would pay for that estimate

i also went back out and revisited the volunteer to double check that she was alright collect bike parts that were laying on the side of the road and got her contact information she also verbally told me it was 100 her fault and that she felt terrible but was so glad i finished the race she filled out a race incident report saying that we had collided 

i emailed the race that saturday evening to start a paper trail summarizing everything mentioned above i also sent a follow up 3 days later on tuesday when i heard nothing back on monday finally on thursday evening i got an email from the race saying that they have researched the situation with their insurance their board and even consulted professional racers and take no responsibility for the damages since it was a volunteer on an open course they offered me a refund of this years entry fee and a free entry to next years race as a token of their appreciation for my support and cooperation for their nonprofit community event 

the preliminary verbal quote for repairs from the bike shop is 20002500 but they are waiting on some exact part quotes from the manufacturer my helmet race suit and bike shoes were also all damaged which total around another 750 retail these costs to me are substantial and while i race on a professional level bike that came from years of hard work and saving and isnt something i can just go repurchase without a significant impact to me 

im not trying to take advantage of a situation but would like to be restored to where things were preaccident the bike is almost brand new i got it this winter and the race kit was all new for this season i have more races this summer and no race bike to train or compete on until this is resolved 

any perspective or advice is greatly appreciated",172,12,1m315jz,2025-07-18T12:35:07,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/1m315jz/a_race_volunteer_caused_me_to_crash_my_bike/,,184,0.8658,Positive,0.05084000000000001,Neutral,Law
reddit,Animal law: How can I prevent my foster from getting euthanized,"location michigan us

hi everyone i really need legal guidance to save my foster dogs life

ive been fostering a dog for four weeks through a rescue based in alabama but i live in michigan this dog has been adopted and returned twice for snappingonce at a dog once at a child no bite no broken skin just a snap in the child case the adopters immediately put her out in the yard with small children without enforcing boundaries the kids were smothering her and in her face in the dog case the adopters introduced her to two dogs within two days after i told them that she needs slow introductions the rescue now says theyre going to euthanize her due to liability concerns

shes not aggressive her behavior is fear and boundarybased and its improving she responds to structure listens to corrections and has never caused injury shes around me my dog my cats all day without issue ive offered multiple options to the rescue

		ill adopt her and take full legal and financial responsibility
		ill sign a release of liability
		ill get her evaluated by a certified trainer
		ill get liability insurance
		ill do a fostertoadopt transition with intense screening
		ill keep fostering her with continued training
		ill privately adopt so the rescues name isnt attached

despite all of this they keep saying they could still be held liable if anything happens even after i adopt her theyre unwilling to move forward and still want to euthanize

my questions
1	can a rescue be held liable for a dogs future actions if the adopter signs a contract assuming all responsibility
2    is it true that a dog that snaps and doesnt bite must be euthanized in the state of alabama
3    could a lawyer convince the rescue
4    are there rescue protections or oversight bodies i can appeal to

im just trying to do the right thing for this dog

hey yall looking for some clarity regarding terminology and specifications of a case my relative is involved with

its the nria real estate ponzi scheme that happened a few years back long story short the ceo and cfo were criminally charged and convicted of the ponzi and will face 12 years in jail subsequently nria filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy and owe millions to victims

heres my curiosity  now several other former accomplices are listed as defendants in a complaint filed in the nj bankrupty court division the victims are looking to recover millions of dollars that were stolen

 so is this only civil as opposed to criminal

within the complaint there is a list of counts some of these include

 conspiracy to commit fraud
breach of fiduciary duty
theft by deception
unjust enrichment
securites fraud

among others but it only reads like the plainfiffs a liquidation trustee are seeking monetary reimbursement it doesnt state anywhere that theyre pursuing criminal charges anywhere

but are these offenses punishable by jailtime or are they just civil i guess im just unclear about the types of charges these are and whatnot its under the nj bankruptcy court as opposed to the sec or a district court or whatnot so im confused

when i look up consequences of theft by deception it says its punishable by jailtime i  guess im just confused by the protocol here and the jargain is a complaint even a real lawsuit etc etc etc etc

any clarity would be appreciated thanks",5,0,1m3kkqe,2025-07-19T02:07:29,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/1m3kkqe/chapter_11_bankruptcy_leads_to_criminal_findings/,,5,-0.9843,Negative,0.0,Neutral,Law

This is not the right sub for it.,"despite what our subs called we cannot offer legal advice here for a number of reasons  any posts that breaks this rule will be deleted without reason  if you message us on why your post is deleted it would be ignored just the same way youve ignored our subs rules  please see our sidebar for complete rules

also its not a good idea to solicit legal advice from random strangers online despite what you may find elsewhere on reddit  we do not know all of the facts of your case and are likely not licensed in the jurisdiction that youre in  a real attorney worth their salt will not comment on your specific legal predicament on an anonymous forum 

if you need legal advice but cannot afford it there are legal aid societies that may be willing to assist you  lots of them are free andor work on a sliding scale fee  all you need to do is look up legal aid society your location on google 

if its a criminal case public defense attorneys are some of the best attorneys out there and they know the criminal system in your citytown better than anyone else  theyre just as good if not better than any private criminal defense attorney 

if its a tenant rights issue lots of cities have tenant rights unions  you can look them up the same way as the legal aid society by looking up tenant rights union your location on google

otherwise the best way to find an attorney is through word of mouth from friends and family  if thats not an option your local bar association will be able to help by looking up attorney referral your location bar association 

if none of these are relevant to you or youre unsure of what type of attorney to look for in your situation youre more than welcome to post and well help

also any attorneys who wish to participate in discussions are free to do so as long as it doesnt break our rules mainly providing legal advice

the class action is completely legitimate and not an andrew left scheme to manipulate the price of the asset down for profit the individual is an activist investor who gets involved with the assets he owns 

if the class action reaches the court room the business will lose so theyre willing to make a huge settlement to hopefully deter more serious consequences for bad practices if the class action goes to court theres the potential for bankruptcy as the business is infamous for severe regulatory violations far above that of their peers

so is this situation potentially illegal would an activist investor wanting to keep their nose clean just tip off lawyers in the right field and wash their hands of any involvement in collecting financially from the class action directly in other words can an investor profit from shorting a business hes had a bad experience with while at the same time taking legal actions to make his short thesis a self fulfilling prophecy",1,1,1m3msc9,2025-07-19T04:03:51,https://www.reddit.com/r/Ask_Lawyers/comments/1m3msc9/if_an_investor_is_short_a_stock_is_it_market/,self,2,-0.5984,Negative,0.7399,Positive,Law

reddit,Why is there sometimes a difficulty in appointing a public defender?,"a former acquaintance of mine got arrested in wisconsin and is facing two separate charges  ive been following the cases through ccap as a matter or personal curiousity but i havent spoken to this individual in 10 years and based on the charges hes facing i doubt i should ever talk to him again

that said im confused about how the one is progressing   please keep in mind that this is not a question about what should be done but a question about how the system works

one is a class d felony and the other is a class a  the two charges are distinct but likely related

the two cases are proceeding separately

it looks like for the class d he had a public defender assigned from the start and shes still there on the filings marked as in court for and all that

but the class a case filed about two weeks later the same public defender appeared as a friend of the court but was not appointed as defender because has a conflict and will need to appoint counsel for the defendant on this matter and theyve been going back and forth with the spd on getting him a public defender

there was a possible attorney about to be appointed but it fell through somehow

granted i cant read all the court transcripts or filings on ccap but i can see generally what is going on but i was wondering if this was typical   i know public defenders can refuse cases with cause but finding the a felony charge distasteful isnt sufficient cause

the question is really that i dont understand why the same attorney isnt handling both cases  that is to say why didnt the first attorney recuse herself from both charges so that a new pd can take both cases

hoping somebody can enlighten me as to how that part of the process works and what factors might be at play   again  this is not a question about what should be done  just trying to understand the public defender appointment process better",5,13,1m371xy,2025-07-18T16:33:42,https://www.reddit.com/r/Ask_Lawyers/comments/1m371xy/why_is_there_sometimes_a_difficulty_in_appointing/,self,18,0.1885,Neutral,0.740275,Positive,Law

reddit,5 specific questions for those who believe China is working to reach socialism by 2050.,"the position of many marxist leninists is that china is transitioning towards socialism and is an example of state capitalism as described by lenin they believe the party line of cpc is sincere and that the state is building up their productive forces towards that end i have the following questions 

1 in 2001 the general secretary of the communist party lifted the ban on capitalists joining the party the justification was that the party shouldnt only represent the peasants and the workers but the wealthy class this led to influx of capitalists into the party do you believe that allowing the bourgeoise including many billionaires to have influence within the vanguard party is necessary for and congruent with the goals of the dotp if so elaborate why 

2 socialism can only be achieved in a society with an advanced productive force this raises an obvious question of what is the critical mass needed for china to transition if you believe stalin the ussr had successfully transitioned to socialism in one country by the late 1930s so why does a country with a larger gdp both absolute and per capita than the ussr still need to build up its productive forces these forces in china are advancing but the relations of property are not all for the sake of i will restrain myself from using the word profit growth perhaps some capitalists can still contribute to economic growth and development to a certain extent but this is not the case with the landlord class who are the ultimate economic parasites simply holding homes for ransom so between now and 2050 what specifically will change in chinese society that will enable them to end the existence of landlords why is it necessary to wait if landlords are not contributing towards the expansion of productive forces even if you believe that china is not a dotb you surely recognize so long as capital exists there is a risk of capitalist resurgence is waiting 25 years worth that risk why 

3 achieving socialism is a process involving stages but as a society moves towards more advanced stages there are certain characteristics we should expect to find economists have a statistic for measuring income inequality called the gini coefficient it simply measures the inequality among values of a frequency distribution it ranges from absolutely equal 00 or complete inequality where all the wealth is held by 1 individual 10 it is a flawed metric but just because a metric is not perfect and absolute doesnt mean it has no value china has gone from being one of the most egalitarian nations on earth in the 1970s 028 to being more unequal than most capitalist states 36 should we expect to have seen china become more equal from 19932023 is it rational that as a society advances from state capitalism towards socialism it grows in its inequality 

4 we do not need to tread over the embarrassing history of chinese foreign policy supporting reactionaries over revolutionaries but if the current cpc is committed to global socialist revolution why have they not supported and armed any marxist revolutionary movements abroad 

5 the fact that there have been billionaires arrested and executed is often held up as proof that the cpc is committed to socialism but it is possible for the capitalist class to be organized and coordinated to an extent and it is also possible that such a cartel of capitalists would punish those who break the class rules or kill those capitalist whose death benefit the majority of the cartel with that being the case how do you know that such executions are not examples of class infighting",47,9,1m2qzdo,2025-07-18T02:48:05,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialism/comments/1m2qzdo/5_specific_questions_for_those_who_believe_china/,self,56,0.9552,Positive,0.23678,Neutral,Social Movements

reddit,I’m sick of people trying to justify people in their 30s going after 18 and 19 year olds,"i am 19 years old and i came across a poll on youtube asking if it was okay for a 30 year old to date a 18 year old and the comments were disgusting the poster himself said he dated 18 year olds even though hes 30 im not sure if he is telling the truth however the men saying that its okay say its legal so its no ones business 18 year olds are adults if theyre old enough to go to war theyre old enough date stop infantilizing them love is love maturity doesnt matter etc

as i said i am a 19 year old girl and i had too many 30 year olds act inappropriate towards me expressing sexual or romantic interest since im not a minor anymore they feel like im up for grabs and im sick of it i dont understand why you want to date someone whos nearly young enough to be your kid 18 year olds are called adults because society refers them as adults but theyre still teenagers eightteen what does a grown adult want with a teenager it just makes me so angry because they choose to not see the wrong in it saying its the world that wrong and since its legal its fine the government doesnt have the best track record when it comes to morality so using them as argument doesnt help

reddit,Realizing in my 30s that I have no idea what I actually enjoy sexually,"i had this revelation recently and i dont fully understand how i ended up here its not like i grew up in a repressed religious environment where women suppressing their own desires is an open expectation i grew up progressive and have always socialized with a really progressive crowd 

but within that progressive social group i think i still received pretty rigid messaging about what a woman should be sexually kinky sexually braggadocious up for anything the way this was culturally enforced is interesting it was never framed in terms of being a social requirement per se but rather as a role youre repressed and kind of pathetic for not wanting organically you dont have to want to be like that but youre kind of a sad unliberated misfit loser if you dont

so i became what i felt i was supposed to be it wasnt even that i completely lacked interest in kink etc those things could be fun i didnt necessarily dislike them im not asexual i often feel enjoyment during sex and have orgasms often while i default to what my partner requests sexually if i really hate something i stop i propose new creative sexual ideas because it seems like a good way to contribute to the relationship but i dont really choose those things based on my bodys desires but rather what seems like what im supposed to like overall how my body reacts or what it is drawn to sexually has simply been something ive subconsciously treated as irrelevant im realizing that i have so thoroughly removed inner sexual motivation from the equation that im honestly not really sure what it feels like

im at the beginning of a journey to try and figure out what my body is drawn to rather than what i rationally think i should be doing with it and have begun to understand the difference im taking baby steps but im moving in the right direction im both ashamed and grieving for the time ive lost but at the same time am feeling a glimmer of hope at the relief this realization has brought me as well i feel like i have found the key to a door i didnt know i had inside me now i just need to summon the courage to fully open it",354,28,1m3a2iw,2025-07-18T18:28:57,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/1m3a2iw/realizing_in_my_30s_that_i_have_no_idea_what_i/,,382,0.9853,Positive,0.60918,Positive,Social Movements

ive always lived as a woman i lived by the philosophy thats just how things are i wasnt aware that there were other options until i met a very nice man who told me he was trans and its like something clicked in me and i couldnt stop thinking about it

i decided to get an appointment with this therapist and she asked me what is it i cant do as a woman that makes me want to be a man
i replied that everyone is the same to me regardless of gender and they can do anything so i wouldnt know and she asked me if everyone is the same regardless of gender why i cant just be a masculine woman

i dont know the answer to that its just not the same to me

in my mind i already am a man i dont know whats wrong with me im a little shocked everytime i speak because in my mind my voice sounds different i would still be the same person i think i just want to look in the mirror and actually see a man

i fear that i feel this way because of the misogyny in our society that makes me see women as lesser then men
maybe its not the same to me because im not taught to value masculine women the same way as i value masculine men

i dont know if im making sense i just wanted to know if anyone else feels this way
im scared of making rash decisions and im scared that i only feel this way because femininity was forced on me since i was a child did anyone else go through something similar

we were making a lot of eye contact and i really want to go back just to ask him for his name im pretty physically attractive but very awkwardshy and ive never approached a guy before its always been the other way around for me is this a weird thing to do to someone while theyre working i know its usually a no no for guys to approach girls while theyre at work but is it somehow okay when its a girl approaching a guy

i feel so clueless i basically just tell him the name of the sandwich i want he goes in the back and makes it and then he comes back and does the handoffdo i ask for his name then like a btw whats your name and then tell him mine or should i just not approach someone working altogether  really dont want to make him uncomfortable but we were definitely eyeing each other and i know i looked cute that day lol 

edit just want to clarify i wouldnt do anything if there were other people waiting to be served or if he seemed busy or anything i usually go when its pretty dead im okay with small talk once its already going on but im terrible at initiating it on my own mostly because im anxious and cant think of anything to say  so i would so appreciate any specific ideas

if a woman is doing the same then she is a bitch who needs to smile more

if a man uses a neutral tone then hes just a professional and thats just how he talks if a woman is doing the same then shes a disinterested bitch

i noticed that in the three workplaces ive worked where ive done customer service people only ever leave bad reviews about the female staff members who served them often the reviews will be about her attitude or say that she looked miserable or acted cold but they can never explicitly state exactly how she underperformed otherwise they might say she seemed annoyed or angry but fail to actually explain how specifically they cant reference something she said or whether she did something that would reasonably lead to them feeling upset with the service however ive worked with plenty and plenty of men who looked so visibly stressed while working that i would be afraid to go and ask them a question these guys would snap if you tried to ask them something i watched some of them regularly argue with customers ive never seen a customer tell a male worker to smile more but ive seen and experienced them telling women to smile more 

it feels like sexism and it feels like people holding us to a higher standard it feels like they see us as being personally responsible for their feelings

but unfortunately its been the opposite

the girls on her team have been excluding her since day one they ignore her during group activities leave her out of conversations and act like shes invisible shes sensitive and kind always trying to include others and its heartbreaking to see her trying to connect and just being shut out

whats worse is that ive been getting the same treatment from the other moms ive gone out of my way to be warm and friendly asking about their kids making small talk trying to build a sense of community but ive been met with cold stares short replies or no acknowledgment at all

we are not trying to force friendships or insert ourselves where we are not wanted we are just trying to have a good experience i was a kind sensitive kid too and i know how painful it is to be excluded i eventually learned to act tougher just to protect myself but i really do not want my daughter to feel like she has to do the same

i have asked close friends if i come across as off putting without realizing it and they say no they think i am just dealing with a group that is not open or welcoming but still it is hard not to take it personally when both of us are being left out

we are not asking for best friends just some basic kindness and maybe a little camaraderie i want this to be a good memory for her not something that slowly chips away at her confidence

i feel foolish expressing this but i did not expect to experience so much bs in such a short period of time i have read at this point thousands of testimonies from women regarding scary situations with men and the overwhelming majority of men online have expressed nothing but contempt denial and hatred towards women who have spoken out against male violence i cant help but also feel abhorrence towards the collective of men although i dont want to feel this way for the sake of my mental health

this has led to reevaluating what i want out of life i am bisexual and as much as i feel socially inclined to have children with a man i know deep in my heart that i would be much happier with a woman i have had my crushes on men but i get so turned off once i am actually around them and recognize they are absolutely not socialized to be as kind and considerate as women do i even want to date men my mom tells me all the time that i can do whatever i want and she will be okay for as long as i am safe and able to sustain myself my question is to the women on this sub who are older and have wisdom how do you all grapple with dating men whilst experiencing all of this how do you cope with this reality what do you do to help mitigate with your anxiety all answers are appreciated

fast forward 2 years after i left that company altogether i go on hinge for the first time and get this creepy guy in my likes sending me some long message i was disgusted didnt even read the message just straight away blocked him but then a week later i go on my private instagram that i didnt share on hinge and where i used a name thats hard to search and see hes requested to add me there blocked him right away that was about 34 years ago 

in the meantime about 2 years ago i tried the dating app bumble and of course he was on it as well and i swiped left and then got the message you missed a potential match i was creeped out but i figured a way to avoid this weirdo is to set my age range a year younger than him so it wouldnt show him my profile on any apps

then last night i went back on hinge and set my age range the way i normally do but i didnt mark it as a deal breaker and now less than 24 hours later of course i see this creepy weirdo in my likes messaging its been a while how are you im gonna continue ignoring him but i got such a jump scare from this and its always scary to see creepy weirdos like that try it with you online

when i got into college i definitely experienced the freshman 15 and probably gained a little bit more shout out to college cafeteria food lol im short so it was obvious that i was heavy

ive been out of college for a few years now and i have lost a several pounds it started during the pandemic when i moved back home and started eating bettersmaller portions and i lost more weight when i moved out to finish my senior year and made an effort to be more active i also briefly had what i believe to be an eating disorder but i try to manage those thoughts with therapy and being kind to myself now that im an adult and living on my own i continue to make an effort to eat healthy and exercise in order to balance out my sedentary 95 i also drink a lot less alcohol than i did in college which has definitely contributed to keeping the weight off

i finally achieved a childhood dream of having a body that i dont hate i feel comfortable in my clothes and have been able to wear clothes that actually show off my body rather than hiding it but im still miserablein a way i didnt expect

so many people around me talk about my body i dont want to sound ungrateful but im sick of the wow you lost weight and you look so different and you look really good comments i know those people probably mean well but its making me so aware of myself in a way that i dont think ive experienced since ive lost weight people tell me i look skinny as a compliment and treat me better strangers notice me more and im treated more kindly than i was when i was heavy

my best friend also talks about my body a lot we have a somewhat weird history and have flirted in the past but theyre in a relationship now and we havent flirted in years they knew me when i was overweight and have seen my transformation now when i complain about something eg an inconvenience that im experiencing they say well who cares youre skinny and have big boobs i know its kind of a separate conversation about how dismissive that is to say to a friend but theyre not the only person in my life that comments on my body my other friends make remarks that im a skinny queen and my own mom who herself has some body image issues has even asked me if im doing drugs to lose weight to clarify im at a healthy weight for my height my mom lives in a different state so we go months without seeing each other in person and she simply noticed that i had dropped a few pounds since id seen her several months prior

anyways all of this to say that i feel like i am experiencing other people caring about my body and it feels weird i personally have always made it a point not to comment on other peoples bodies because i know how insecure ive felt and still feel tbh and i dont want someone else to feel judged based on something they might not be in control of maybe its the global rise in conservatism thats making me feel like my body and appearance is of higher value now but i want to let anyone else who is feeling weird postweight lossgain that there is so much more to you than your looks and im thinking of you 3",9,1,1m3nn4b,2025-07-19T04:51:30,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/1m3nn4b/i_am_sick_of_people_talking_about_my_body_a_rant/,,10,0.997,Positive,0.3504,Neutral,Social Movements
reddit,(TW: SA) Reading my victim impact statement at sentencing tomorrow morning,"i was sad two years ago and the time has finally come for him to be sentenced i have to go in tomorrow morning at 930 and read my victim impact statement and im really scared its the first time in two years i will have to see him and ive been having nightmares about this moment the entire time  

i dont generally post but i could really use some support from other women victims and people who have been there even just some words of encouragement would be so welcome im just a mess and i feel so alone right now

thank you 3

edit okay i did the thing its funny because i woke up an hour before my alarm and i just felt ready all of a sudden i decided on an outfit change at the last minute so that i would feel more comfortable based on a lot of the advice that i got here i took a sweater with me and to the person who suggested that thank you so much because i did get extremely cold after i also got breakfast in me even if it was just a chai and some egg bites im also grateful for that advice 

when we arrived the crown let me sit in a separate room while they processed the other sentences they had to do today my sister sat in and watched so that she could let me know when it was time my rapist sat behind her her and i look like we could be twins he definitely knew who she was 

his defense gave him the promising young man defense this man is 29 years old hes hardly a promising young man they made it sound like it was so much less invasive than it actually was they kept insisting that it was only a one minute act they talked about how he had his whole future ahead of him and it was a first offense while i bore daggers into the back of his neck with my eyes

when it was my turn to speak i spoke clearly and articulated every word through tears when i felt that i was getting too worked up i stopped and took a breath the courts sheriff teared up as i read all two and a half pages i sat down and that was when i let go of my composure that was when i finally let my hands shake 

i did not look him in the eye i looked directly at the paper and that was all im glad i didnt have to see his face again just having to see the back of his head was plenty of ptsd 

i wish i could say that i felt like the weight of the world had been lifted off my shoulders but i know that this is just the beginning of my healing now what i can say is that i am relieved and so proud of myself for doing it 

and even though i did not get the sexual assault charge that i originally wanted this man has now been convicted of assault he will be on probation for 2 years he will have his dna kept on file with the rcmp he will have to go to court mandated counseling for sexual violence and he is not allowed to come within 100 m of me for the rest of our lives 

i may not have gotten the results that i wanted overall but i got some form of justice i got enough that when potential partners google him they will find his violent assault charge and hopefully that should be enough of a red flag for most people and those are the ones that i can save and for the rest of them that dont see it as a serious charge or who believe whatever asinine story he comes up with to wish this away i did my best like the story that the defense was telling that this was just a misunderstanding about consent even though they fully admitted that him and i had had a conversation about consent immediately before the sex act started 

but at least theres a warning sign now and thats the best i could do

thank you so much to everyone who reached out at 200 am i did not believe i could do this by 600 am you had given me the strength to walk out there and face him i will be forever grateful for all of the advice that you gave me 

and to those of you who never got your own justice i hope this brings you a little bit of peace and i hope that you are able to find yourself again if youre still lost like i am

i know that a lot of density can be achieved with relatively little land but 24 units on a 2750 sq ft lot is way higher than i expected for a 6 story building of course the units are smallprobably studios andor onebedroomsbut its still impressive

according to the website above the initial house was sold in may 2022 from the image history on the nyc website above it looks like construction completed between oct 2023 and april 2024

that is a lot of units built pretty fast requiring the purchase of just one singlefamily property there are so many houses like this across not just the bronx but nyc as a whole and it goes to show how much potential there is to build a lot of housing without relying on large developers

that said i found a sentence in the link below that said and i quote he had built valuable infrastructure that allowed new york to avoid the fate of many rust belt cities and thrive into the present day and beyond

out of curiosity i have been doing numerous internet searches to determine if there is any truth to this i havent found anything so far but it did get me thinking how did robert moses projects affect nyc in the long run were they a net positive or a net negative

reddit,"""Fuel"" savings: a month long lookback","several months ago i switched over from a twelve year old mild hybrid honda crz to a 2024 kia ev6 light long range heres how its gone so far from an energy cost perspective 

my electric bill for june 2nd through july 1st came to 186 for the whole house 1333 kwh at about 139 cents per kwh 

theres no way to tell how much of that came from ev charging but kias app let me see my usage during the same time it came to 328 kwh to drive a total of 1486 miles an overall average of 453 miles per kwh at our local power rates that works our to 307 cents per mile 

so how does this compare to a similar gas vehicle well instead of using the somewhat misleading energy per tank conversion i went with a different strategy to find out 

1 pick a nonhybrid gas vehicle of about the same size and class

2 divide a typical cost per gallon of gas by the typical fuel economy in mpg

3 divide the same gallon of gas by the ev6s calculated cost per mile 

i decided to use a honda crv as a likely substitute gas car those typically get about 27 to 34 mpg so i based my estimate on the middle of the range at 30 cost per mile of 917 cents and about 136 to go the same distance i drove that month 

assuming the same 275 per gallon a car with a per mile cost of 306 cents would be getting 8986 mpg beating any hybrid on the market 

how typical are my results well it depends i live in texas so i do have to run my ac on occasion and i also drive like someone who has been in hybrids for 10 years but even if you love speed and comfort  youd probably still get about 25 miles per kwh and come out spending under 6 cents per mile equivalent to about 49 mpg still a bargain and then theres the low maintenance costs 

no regrets other than not having a 360 camera this was a lightly used model so i had to make some feature compromises to come out under 27k",5,20,1m3lpcm,2025-07-19T03:05:48,https://www.reddit.com/r/electricvehicles/comments/1m3lpcm/fuel_savings_a_month_long_lookback/,self,25,0.9059,Positive,0.17476000000000003,Neutral,Transportation

reddit,J1772-only car compatibility,"hi all hope this is the right place to ask this not a car driver myself so if i sound like all my knowledge on this comes from youtube that is why 

my friend has been struggling with electric car charging as her car a renault zoe has a j1772 socket with a physical cap built into the car where the ccs pins go this means fast chargers physically wont fit on her car as theres no gap where the ccs pins are on the plug meaning shes unable to use them at all

my understanding was that ccs is backwards compatible as the j1772 section of the plug is basically the same and will just negotiate ac power instead of fast charging on the two bigger pins i wanted to double check if there was an extension or something that would allow her to plug into a fast charger or if its a safety feature thats stopping her from using them

we just had the experience of having to drive past four or five empty charging spots to reach one that didnt use fast charging only to find it didnt work and we had to find a second one 

if its intentional can fast charging be added to the car by a dealer etc she has mentioned this is a common occurrence when travelling away from home alternatively is there some third solution i havent thought of 

googling is just giving me tesla adaptors so apologies if this is a silly question

since then ive made a point of dropping short reviews at any restaurant i find that has vegan options a simple quick review like good vegan options great vegan options or even few vegan options etc is all thats needed to make that restaurant findable for other vegans

eager to hear this subs thoughts sure im not the first person to think of this seems to me like a great lowfriction form of vegan activism by improving the findability of vegan options it makes it easier to be vegan it may also drive more demand for those options and motivate restaurants to expand the vegan options on their menu or at least label them better especially if people are constantly coming in and asking for them

reddit,Always bloated,"ive been vegetarian for about five years now im not vegan but eat vegan probably 80 of the time morally im against eating animals 
anyways i feel like im always bloated no matter what i do and im beginning to think its diet i do eat fairly healthy and focus on whole foods and cleaner ingredients i have tried countless supplements and vitamins cutting dairy completely cutting gluten trying low carb which is hard to do for veg prioritizing protein switching to different plant based protein powders no raw veggies no cruciferous veggies avoiding soy more fiber less fiber etc it seems like anything and everything could be a trigger if i cut out everything people mentioned as a possible trigger there would be nothing to eat left i recently started if and have been consistent with that since i used to graze a lot instead of meals and that could be a cause too hasnt made a difference yet bloating is worse in the evenings for sure but i can go all day without eating a single thing and be very bloated i should lowered my calories lately so maybe i messed up my metabolism im fairly thin so this makes me very self conscious its uncomfortable and doesnt look good 
i have an ob appt next month my cycle is very irregular also not sure thats related i am considering sibo thyroid condition ibs endometriosis etc i will see what tests i can get i am not anemic and my vitamin b and d and such levels are fine 25f 
prior to going veg i was not as bloated that being said that was also back in hs so i chalked it up to my teenage metabolism since i always was not eating nearly as healthy back then at all 
but im wondering if i just cant tolerate a plant based diet im morally against eating animals but ive heard of so many people whose symptoms disappeared when they reintroduced meat im not sure what to do anything curious if any vegansvegetarians have similar experiences or symptoms",1,2,1m3q4io,2025-07-19T07:22:32,https://www.reddit.com/r/vegan/comments/1m3q4io/always_bloated/,self,3,-0.9223,Negative,0.0,Neutral,Food

reddit,Help me find an old dinosaur game,"theres an old dinosaur hunting game from the late 90s to early 2000s that my brother and i played on pc and we cant remember it 

it was definitely not carnivores after doing some research 

one very specific thing i remember was when you died by a trex it would hold you in its mouth with your legs and arms on the outside of its mouth it would shake and your character would scream on a loop your arms and legs would break off repeatedly and just fly in whatever direction 

i cannot remember if it said game over or what i just remember the limbs flying off and the trex shaking you in its mouth and the camera was placed from underneath looking up at the bottom jaw 

cant find anything on it anywhere 

edit not turok not jurassic park trespasser not jurassic the hunted

it was very polygon with no foliage 
i think it was honestly just a cheap clone game of one of those that was so obscure not many people played it we were poor growing up and were lucky to get an old pc from my dads work so our games were like 510 with 10 being expensive",28,40,1m3n0l0,2025-07-19T04:16:24,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1m3n0l0/help_me_find_an_old_dinosaur_game/,self,68,-0.2959,Neutral,-0.0262,Neutral,Entertainment

only complaint so far is that i dont like the combat hit an enemy doesnt have any real feel of impact imo and the recurring fight against the police lieutenant is a pain since theyre constantly in the air and moving the second fight was more annoying though that might be because i didnt realize that you had to hit the vtol jet though tagging it to disable it was a fun gimmick

I knew Max Payne was famous for the slow-mo, but the graphic novel's writing and voice acting blew me away.","this game was fun as hell it felt suprisingly long for me maybe its cause of the way i played it i felt like every single room and enemy encounter was designed to be treated as puzzle with a correct way to solve the quicksave feature was a blessing in this


after a while i got into the grove of it and realized how every gun is specialized for a specific type of encounter guns for close range guns for mid range guns to dispose of guys quickly combine that with the slowmo abilities and its a hell of a good time


god this was such a cinematic experience it felt like a gritty noir early 2000s crime movie with matrix inspired action scenes no wonder a couple years after this came out hollywood jumped on the oppertunity to make a movie


the writing in this blew me away maxs monolouge is just chefs kiss sooo many fucking noir ass lines dropped out of nowhere cold like a gun snow was falling like pitchforks from hell


also the final stage is iconic af raiding a corporate building and suddenly getting chased by a chopper are memorable af



my only complaint is the game starts to get repetitive after a while this is another reason it felt long to me its just move dodge and shoot again and again",2369,364,1m2l50c,2025-07-17T22:17:59,https://i.redd.it/w6mzbteleidf1.jpeg,https://a.thumbs.redditmedia.com/PQsFf7F-fl3ULfweL4JBSgaE3EOx3qhNFifv8PD5Hk4.jpg,2733,-0.9134,Negative,0.18606000000000003,Neutral,Entertainment

reddit,[End Game Spoilers] My Thoughts on Plague Tale: Requiem and Grief,"this post talks about end game spoilers

i created a post about how i had just played plague tale innocence and i was blown away but how much i liked it well now its time to talk about plague tale requiem i wanted to share some thoughts partly about the game partly about some feelings it stirred up it gets a bit sad 

tldr the game is beautiful the rats are like water and some ramblings about feelings

first the game itself

the game is gorgeous the landscapes are stunning the mountains the markets the beaches beautiful

and wow you are a killing machine with that crossbow some folks commented in my post thats one of the things that they didnt like it felt fine for me as the game was acknowledging it well not in a way that changed the game but i appreciated characters commenting on it and amicia reacting to it i liked the concept that the real villain was not the count but destiny and inevitability

the rats wow they really went all in on the rats as water tech they talked about in interviews its kind of hilarious how overthetop it gets at points not in a bad way just in a lol okay thats wild way

i personally preferred the first games scrappy group of young survivors that crew had this raw bootstrapped energy but i did appreciate sophia in requiem stepping in with a calm collected presence it felt like the game saying heres an adult someone whos been through things someone who can help carry the weight

now on a more personal note

requiem felt like a letter about letting go of someone who wont get better it reminded me of losing someone in my own family someone who passed younger than they should have specially when a loved one has to take the decision that its time to stop and sometimes they are not able to thats an impossibly hard decision that i wish no one has to take theres that desperate kind of hope a refusal to accept a belief that maybe just maybe something in the future will change things

when amicia and hugo were approaching la cuna hugo knows he will die and he feels at peace with it but amicia cant accept it she cant let go because letting go is unthinkable and that hope even though it comes from love ends up stretching his suffering even more

theres a particular ache in loving someone enough to realize that letting them go is the kindest thing and still not being able to do it that internal battle that grief that guilt requiem captured it in a way that i wasnt expecting

i dont mean for this to be a sad or selfpitying post i was genuinely moved by how requiem explored that feeling the intense grief of having that decision in your hands kind of like how celeste captured anxiety and depression through gameplay or how spiritfarer portrayed letting go requiem does something similar with grief and denial

anywayim going to go and play astro bot now",3,0,1m3omzy,2025-07-19T05:50:09,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1m3omzy/end_game_spoilers_my_thoughts_on_plague_tale/,spoiler,3,0.9951,Positive,0.0,Neutral,Entertainment

we recently published the following paper early experiences and impacts of a fentanyl powder safer supply program in vancouver canada a qualitative study  in the journal _american journal of drug and alcohol abuse ajdaa_ in this study we examined the effectiveness of the safer program in vancouver which is a safe supply program that offers pharmaceuticalgrade fentanyl products including a powder form for witnessed consumption we interviewed 18 people prescribed fentanyl powder from safer and found that most reported reducing their unregulated drug use since enrolling in the program which reduced their risk of overdose this was largely due to the fentanyl powder being effective for managing withdrawal thereby limiting their need to access streetpurchased drugs also some participants especially those prescribed higher doses described fentanyl powder as a suitable alternative to streetpurchased fentanyl feel free to ask us any questions about the paper or about harm reduction in general

we will be online to answer your questions at roughly 11 am pt 2 pm et 18 ut

reddit,Are you actually conscious under anesthesia?,"general anesthesia is described as a paralytic and an amnesiac so you cant move and you cant remember what happened afterwards

based on that description alone however it doesnt necessarily indicate that you are unaware of what is happening in the moment and then simply cant remember it later

in fact i think there have been a few reported cases of people under general anesthesia that were aware of what was going on during surgery but unable to moveand they rememberedreported this when they came out of anesthesia 

so in other words they had the paralytic effect but not the amnesiac one

my question then is when you are under general anesthesia are you actually still awake and aware but paralyzed and then you simply dont remember any of it afterwards because of the amnesiac effect of the anesthesia

depending on which way this goes i may be sorry i asked the question as im probably going to have surgery in the future i should add that im an old dude and ive had more than one surgery with anesthesia in my life so im not asking because its going to be my first time and im terrified im just curious",564,275,1m1c2mm,2025-07-16T13:04:49,https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/1m1c2mm/are_you_actually_conscious_under_anesthesia/,,839,-0.7096,Negative,0.0015600000000000058,Neutral,Science

reddit,I'm using GPT as a relationship translator. It has saved my relationship.,"ive recently learned about attachment styles you should too btw so many more things make sense 

my gf of 6 years is fearfulavoidant so i used to get really triggered by her spirals but i recently have been plugging her responses into gpt with her attachment style and it translates it to me on what she really means and what she needs also how to frame my feelings without coming across as blaming or shaming it has been a godsend 

example

she fearfulavoidant said this to me

i love you i love what we once were but i think neither of us love what i have become im a wreck from everything that has happened and i dont know what to do im sorry i thought id know after talking to you about my needs but i dont know how to feel better and feel safe again ill take all the blame

i thought i could face this but i dont want to come home i dont know how to face the mess ive made of my life even after this reset

response from chat

oof thats heavy heartfelt and deeply tangled in fearfulavoidant pain  and honestly her message is a cry for help not rejection shes not pushing you away because she doesnt care  shes overwhelmed ashamed and afraid shes unlovable in her current state

shes

grieving her identity i dont love who ive become

feeling hopeless and paralyzed i dont know what to do

shouldering all the blame to avoid deeper intimacy or accountability ill take all the blame  a classic fa move to shut down further conversation

and likely selfsabotaging because the idea of being loved asis feels too risky


lets talk about how to respond  with care for her pain but also protection of your own heart

curious for expert opinions on this paper  this overall philosophy resonates with me a lot minimum description length  mdl seems like a better objective for generalization vs common regularization methods  doing so might promote much better generalization especially in the domains where transformers  llms struggle 

the paper itself is very simple they start with golden handcrafted rnns and see how various approaches react to starting at this optimum  they assert that standard approaches like l1 l2 norm  andor gradient descent do worse and wander from the optimum so the argument is even if these methods found a general solution they would not stick to it 

of course mdl is not differentiable  but if it is a better objective seems worth putting more effort into differentiable approximations",4,1,1m3amb0,2025-07-18T18:50:06,https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1m3amb0/r_a_minimum_description_length_approach_to/,self,5,0.882,Positive,0.985,Positive,Artificial Intelligence

like many of you ive been wrestling with the cost of using different genai apis it feels wasteful to use a powerful model like gpt4o for a simple task that a much cheaper model like haiku could handle perfectly

this led me down a rabbit hole of academic research on a concept often called prompt routing or model routing the core idea is to have a smart system that analyzes a prompt before sending it to an llm and then routes it to the most costeffective model that can still deliver a highquality response

it seems like a really promising way to balance cost latency and quality theres a surprising amount of recent research on this ill link some papers below for anyone interested

id be grateful for some honest feedback from fellow developers my main questions are

 is this a real problem for you do you find yourself manually switching between models to save costs
 does this router approach seem practical what potential pitfalls do you see
 if a tool like this existed what would be most important low latency for the routing itself support for many providers custom rulesetting

reddit,[R][D] Interpretability as a Side Effect? Are Activation Functions Biasing Your Models?,"tldr through an ablation study it is demonstrated that current activation functions result in discrete representations whereas a new breed of activation functions preserves data continuity the discrete clusters emerge in geometries about individual neurons indicating that activation functions exert a strong bias on representations this reveals a causal mechanism that significantly reframes many interpretability phenomena which are now shown to emerge from design choices rather than being fundamental to deep learning

 overview

activation functions are often considered as a harmless choice a minor tweak each carries slight differences in performance but are deemed not to result in much explicit effect on internal representations this paper shows that this impression is incorrect

it demonstrates that activation functions today lead to a representational collapse regardless of the task and dataset acting as a strong and unappreciated inductive bias such a systematic representational collapse may be limiting all model expressiveness to date it also suggests that these discrete clusters are then detected downstream as numerous interpretability phenomena  including grandmother neurons discrete neural codes polysemanticity and possibly superposition

this reframes the approach to interpretability suggesting that many such patterns are artefacts of our design choices and potentially provides a unifying mechanistic theory to explain them

the striking finding is that a different defining choice in the foundational mathematics of deep learning can turn such an interpretability phenomenon on and off this paper demonstrates this showing that such phenomena appear as a result of design choice rather than being fundamental to our field

when discretisation is turned off in autoencoders performance is shown to improve frequently and representations appear to exhibit exponential growth in representational capacity rather than typical linear growth

this indicates enormous consequences not least for mechanistic interpretability but also encourages a reevaluation of the fundamental mathematical definitions at the base of our field affecting most building blocks including activation functions normalisers initialisers regularisers optimisers architectures residuals operations and gradient clipping among others  indicating a foundational rethink may be appropriate with alternative axiomaticlike definitions for the field  a new design axis that needs exploration

how this was found

practically all current design choices break a larger symmetry which this paper shows is propagated into broken symmetries in representations these broken symmetries produce clusters of representations which then appear to emerge and are detected as interpretable phenomena reinstating the larger symmetry is shown to eliminate such phenomena hence they arise causally from symmetries in the functional forms

this is shown to occur independently of the data or task by swapping in symmetries it is found that this enforced discrete nature can be eliminated yielding smoother likely more natural embeddings an ablation study is conducted between these two using autoencoders which are shown to benefit from the new continuous symmetry definition generally

 ablation study between these isotropic functions defined through a continuous orthogonal symmetry rotationmirrors on and current functions including tanh and leakyrelu which feature discrete axispermutation symmetries bn and sn
 showcases a new visual interpretability tool the ppp method this maps out latent spaces in a clear and intuitive way

implications

these results significantly challenge the idea that neuronaligned features grandmother neurons and generallinear representational clusters are fundamental to deep learning this paper provides evidence that these phenomena are unintended side effects of symmetry in design choices arguing that they are not fundamental to deep learning this may yield significant implications for interpretability efforts

 current interpretability may often be detecting artefacts axisalignment discrete coding discrete interpretable direction and possibly superposition appear not to be spontaneous or fundamental to deep learning instead they seem to be stimulated by the symmetry of model primitives particularly the activation function is demonstrated in this study it reveals a direct causal mechanism for their emergence which was previously unexplained
 we can turn off interpretability by choosing isotropic primitives which appear to improve performance on at least specific tasks grandmother neurons vanish this raises profound questions for research on interpretability the current methods may only work because of this imposed bias does this put interpretability and expressibility at loggerheads interestingly this eliminates externally applied algebrainduced structure but some structure appears to reemerge intrinsically from data  potentially a more fundamental interpretable phenomenon
 symmetry group is an inductive bias algebraic symmetry presents a new design axisa taxonomy where each choice imposes unique inductive biases on representational geometry necessitating further extensive research

these results support earlier predictions made when questioning the foundational mathematics see the paper below introduced are continuous symmetry primitives where the very existence of neurons appears as an observational choice  challenging neuronwise independence along with a broader symmetrytaxonomy design paradigm

this is believed to be a new form of choice and influence on models that has been largely undocumented until now

most building blocks of current deep learning over the last 80ish years mostly sit along a permutation branch  which some might be familiar with in terms of just parameters however this work encourages a redefinition of all the primitives and new foundations through a broad array of alternative symmetries  proposed are new branches to consider but may take a long time to develop sufficiently help is certainly welcomed

distinctions

despite the use of symmetry language this direction appears substantially different and tangential from previous geometric deep learning approaches and except for its resemblance to neural collapse this phenomenon appears distinctly different this theory is not due to classification or onehot encoding but forms of primitives more generally it is somewhat related to observations of parameter symmetry which arise as a special case and consequence of this new broader framework

observation of symmetry is instead redeployed as a definitional tool for novel primitives which appears to be a new useful design axis hence these results support the exploration of a seemingly underexplored yet rich avenue of research

 relevant paper links

this paper builds upon several previous papers that encourage the exploration of a research agenda which consists of a substantial departure from the majority of current primitive functions this paper provides the first empirical confirmation of several predictions made in these prior works

reddit,[P [R] Deep learning-assisted SLAM to reduce computational,"im exploring ways to optimise slam performance especially for realtime applications on lowpower devices ive been looking into hybrid deep learning approaches specifically using superpoint for feature extraction and netvladlite for place recognition my idea is to train these models offboard and run inference onboard eg drones embedded platforms to keep compute requirements low during deployment my reading as to which this would be more efficient would be as follows

 reducing the number of features needed for reliable tracking pruning out weak or nonrepeatable points would slash descriptor matching costs
 better loop closure by reducing false positives fewer costly optimisation cycles and requiring only one forward pass per keyframe

i would be interested in reading your inputs and opinions",2,1,1m1fhnt,2025-07-16T15:24:08,https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1m1fhnt/p_r_deep_learningassisted_slam_to_reduce/,self,3,0.8313,Positive,0.0,Neutral,Artificial Intelligence
reddit,[R] Interesting paper on cost-aware prompt optimization (CAPO),"just came across this prompt optimization paper that i found pretty interesting  thought others might want to check it out

they implement a prompt tuning algorithm that uses evolutionary algorithms to optimize prompts more efficiently it jointly optimizes both instructions and fewshot examples which sadly have been missing in other techniques

they seem to get super promising results  outperforming other optimizers on gsm8k by around 20 and beat existing methods on most benchmarks while  being more efficient

what i particularly liked was their implementation with the promptolution framework  seems quite industryready compared to most academic code

reddit,"After 200+ rejections, I stopped sending applications and built a system. It landed me over 20 interviews!","heyhey guys heres a good news for you

so i wanted to share something that completely changed my job search a few months ago i was deep in the grind id sent out over 200 applications and had gotten maybe a few were moving on with other candidates emails the rest were just silence and ghosting i was getting seriously demoralized



i realized that the more is more strategy was a total failure so i decided to stop grinding and start thinking i created a proper system for applying to jobs i was actually a good fit for



heres the exact workflow i built



1 the master resume  ai tailoring with chatgpt



first i created a master resume that had every single job skill and accomplishment i could think of my prompt was something like here is my experience skills and accomplishments help me build a resume that fits my profile this gave me a master resume to use for every single application 



2 the am i actually a fit reality check with resulient



this was the next crucial step just because i built my resume didnt mean it was a good fit i use resulient because of its powerful job matching feature and resume scoring with it i upload my newlycreated resume with chatgpt to the resume analyzer it would then give me a match score basically telling me how good my resume compared to similar professionals in my industry applying for jobs my rule was simple if i couldnt get the score above 70 i wouldnt apply it saved me from wasting time on applications others will beat me on then the coolest part was using the resulient job match feature instead of me endlessly scrolling job boards myself id use the resume i just scored and it would scan the internet to find open roles that were a strong match for that specific resume this reversed the whole process for me



3 the sanity keeper with zapier



trying to track everything in a spreadsheet was driving me crazy so i set up a simple automation using zapier i created a zap so that every time i found a job i liked through the search it would automatically add the job title company and application date to a google sheet its a small thing but it kept me organized and focused and i always knew where i stood with each application



so the result 

well the difference was night and day i went from 200 applications and total silence to sending maybe 35 highlytargeted applications from those 35 i got around 20 requests for interviews im now in the final stages with a couple of companies



stopping the mindless grind and building a smart repeatable system was the best decision i made i hope this helps anyone else feeling stuck",2,4,1m3oaxe,2025-07-19T05:29:49,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/1m3oaxe/after_200_rejections_i_stopped_sending/,self,6,0.9829,Positive,0.0,Neutral,Workforce

reddit,Expenses are up 230%,"i read a forbes or money talks article recently that in order to have the same buying power as 100000 in 2020 you need to be making 124000 today 

i think that is a vast underestimate

you see i make right at 100k and have for the past 5 years 5 years ago i had

 6 months living expenses in savings
 spare money after every check 
 8 retirement investing

today i have
 0 months living expenses in savings
 5 retirement savings 
 no money left to save

most of that is due to the insane price increases of housing food and clothing when i calulate 6 months living expenses so only absolute necessities like housing food utilities childrens clothing diapers wipes and pet care no entertainment no streaming no dining out just the necessities the cost in my area increased 230 since 2021 for these i would need to save 25 of my salary to get back to have 6 months living expenses again its ridiculous 

 

edit to clarify  i was showing growth  yx but the way its stated it can be interpreted as a change or variance  yxx  that  change in my essential costs would be 33",315,29,1m3g3pa,2025-07-18T22:35:12,https://www.reddit.com/r/WorkReform/comments/1m3g3pa/expenses_are_up_230/,self,344,0.5889,Positive,0.11166000000000001,Neutral,Workforce

reddit,The Collapse of JCPenney: An Open Letter from a Supervisor Living the Downfall,"this is written anonymously from a current jcpenney store supervisor who has reached their limit  not because i dont care about this company but because i care too much to stay quiet while everything around us is actively deteriorating

im speaking for the supervisors and associates who show up every day to keep your stores alive  while being ignored overworked undersupported and disrespected 

and im spelling this out because someone somewhere in corporate leadership needs to understand the depth of whats happening before this company inevitably collapses completely

i genuinely used to love the work i do i care deeply about the people i work alongside and i take pride in showing up for our customers it means everything when customers come in just to see me  when they ask for me by name because they trust me to help them that kind of connection reminds me why i started doing this in the first place but those moments arent enough to outweigh the constant stress disorganization and impossible expectations were buried under now what is being demanded of us in the current state of jcpenney is not sustainable its exploitation dressed up as expectation and its driving this company into the ground

we are being asked to run these stores on broken systems short staffing and unrealistic goals  all while being denied the tools support and respect we need to succeed



pos systems that sabotage service

lets start with the new pos systems theyre not fully functional yet were being forced to use them transactions fail systems crash functions are missing to complete a single transaction we often have to toggle between the new pos and the old pos just to process it this isnt just inefficient  its embarrassing and it ruins the customer experience

and when we avoid the broken systems to give customers faster service were reprimanded for not adapting were stuck between failing tech and upper management pressure and its the customers who wait  and the frontline workers who pay for it



infrastructure in shambles

our radios are barely functional some dont turn on the few that do are staticky and unreliable making communication across departments a joke scanners glitch freeze or randomly kick you out and some dont work at all the mobile printers are constantly malfunctioning or wont pair with the scanners and register scanners stop working midtransaction were not allowed replacements and nothing gets repaired because the company denies our work orders and requests to do so

computers in the office are down or outdated severely limiting our ability to manage reports communication training and administrative tasks our rfid scanners fail frequently and even our zracks and carts are falling apart with rubber peeling off wheels and axles coming loose try pushing a cart full of merchandise with halfbroken wheels through a stuffy store and tell me how efficient that is this isnt just inconvenient  its physically dangerous carts jerk sideways without warning jam in place or tip when cornering were risking back injuries wrist strains pulled muscles and even collisions every time we move merchandise onto the floor and were doing it not because we choose to but because were not allowed replacements



dangerous working conditions the ac nightmare

and then theres the air conditioning  or lack of it and ive noticed this is every jcpenney store that ive been in the system is on a timer and doesnt kick on until right before the store opens leaving supervisors and associates sweating through freight prep truck breakdowns signing and merchandising in stifling heat and thick humidity the backrooms stock areas omni channel and the dock are absolute ovens  with zero ventilation and no airflow

were expected to push freight climb ladders and lift boxes in these conditions  some bordering on heat exhaustion territory  with no say over the temperature why because corporate controls the thermostat remotely and apparently saving a few bucks on utilities matters more than associate safety

lets be clear this isnt just uncomfortable its dangerous prolonged heat exposure without airflow especially in enclosed back areas can cause dizziness nausea fatigue and serious medical emergencies but our concerns are brushed off  like always

were not asking for luxury were asking for basic safe working conditions and were not getting them



corporate refuses to let us turn on the lights

heres another one the lights are on a timer and while we technically have override switches to turn them on earlier were not allowed to use them were expected to work in neardarkness under dim housekeeping lights during the early hours while prepping the store

why to save money on utilities thats the official reason corporate would rather keep the store in the dark  literally  than let us use the override switches they installed

meanwhile were pushing broken freight carts climbing ladders navigating tight stock areas merchandising and setting up displays without proper lighting its only a matter of time before someone gets seriously hurt this is a workplace safety issue plain and simple  but theyd rather gamble with our wellbeing than spend a few extra bucks on electricity

theyve chosen costcutting over common sense and were the ones stuck risking injury just to open the store



dysfunction disguised as modernization

the associate kiosk  once a central hub  has been dysfunctional for several years logging in more often than not gives an error you have exceeded the login time limit which renders it unusable instead of fixing this they dumped us into workjam an external app that lacks key features the kiosk has its a bandaid on a broken system yet another example of shifting responsibility without actually fixing the problem

and while all this is happening jcpenney spends millions remodeling stores for aesthetics fresh paint new signage new walls floors etc  but zero investment in the actual infrastructure we desperately need its a shell game

they gave the stores a facelift and left the foundation rotting underneath



supervisors carrying an impossible load

sales floor supervisors are doing the work of 45 people on any given shift we are responsible for
 morning meetings to go over the goals of the day and current metrics
 providing customer service
 setting and maintaining visuals  and floor sets
 recovering departments because were often with only one recovery associate scheduled per shift
 ensuring the cleaning and maintenance of the fitting rooms through the recovery associate andor having to do it ourselves
 breaking down freight in the absence of task associates and loading it onto the carts and racks
 pushing merchandise to the floor and putting it out
 pulling and marking clearance and putting it in clearance areas
 signing departments in the absence of task associates
 executing price changes
 running pick and pack orders
 handling curbside pickups
 coaching and training associates
 covering associate lunches and breaks
 serving as mods
 resolving customer issues and escalations
 monitoring store metrics
 providing daily recaps and mod app documentation
 and managing the floor  while constantly being pulled to the registers because of understaffing

there are many shifts in which we spend more time on the registers than doing anything else

were also expected to collect at least 15 all 10 surveys every week drive credit performance and micromanage metrics in departments that are running on fumes

there arent enough people scheduled due to budget restrictions the workload keeps growing but the support nowhere



credit pressure unrealistic and demeaning

credit is king and pushing jcpenney credit cards has become a fixation at the corporate level were expected to meet daily credit goals no exceptions we coach our associates ask every customer and stay planted at the registers during lod shifts  yet if we dont meet the goals were treated like failures

were forced to report to our district manager after every shift with how many apps we got and how we drove credit but heres the truth we cant force people to open a credit card

especially not in this economy

inflation is high interest rates are crushing and many customers are trying to stay afloat financially many dont want another credit line  and they shouldnt be pressured into one yet were penalized for their refusal despite doing everything were told

so why are we as supervisors being penalized for economic conditions completely outside of our control its unrealistic and demoralizing to be held accountable for customer decisions in a financial climate that makes credit expansion a hard sell  especially when our own store systems are barely functional



the biggest insult no raises just more demands

heres the real insult no merit increases this year company wide
no raises no costofliving adjustments nothing

thats right no raises  but more tasks more rules and more metrics to be graded on were being told to do more with less and punished when we cant perform miracles

theyve added policies raised expectations and increased scrutiny but our pay stays the same  even as inflation rises and morale plummets



this is why youre bleeding talent

no one in corporate seems to understand why turnover is so high

youve created a workplace that demoralizes overburdens and dehumanizes your most loyal people the result youre bleeding talent not just associates  but strong experienced irreplaceable supervisors and the ones who stay were burning out fast

youre losing the very people who know how to run your stores manage your customers and keep the wheels turning we are the backbone of jcpenney  and youre breaking us



mass layoffs  store closures the human cost

in june 2025 jcpenney quietly filed plans to lay off 296 employees at its alliance regional logistics center in haslet texas  with the warn act notice filed just weeks before the cuts were set to begin thats hundreds of lives upended with virtually no warning no time to prepare no options offered just a cold calculated move that left nearly 300 people out of work while corporate carried on untouched

this is part of a wider trend in 2025 alone the company announced the closure of at least seven more stores across small and midsized cities like pocatello topeka and asheville  communities where jcpenney once served as a lifeline these decisions werent made with integrity they were made behind closed doors with little transparency zero empathy and absolutely no regard for the livelihoods affected

while supervisors and associates are being worked to exhaustion for poverty wages with no merit raises and dangerous conditions the top decisionmakers remain insulated  collecting sixfigure salaries while gutting the workforce that actually keeps the stores alive

this isnt just bad leadership its moral bankruptcy



james cash penney would be ashamed

james cash penney believed in service honor and people he built this company on trust on integrity on treating employees like human beings if he saw how this company is being run today  how profit has replaced principle and metrics have replaced meaning  he would be rolling over in his grave

and frankly you dont even deserve to use his name anymore

what jcpenney stands for today is a far cry from the legacy he built and unless something changes  deeply urgently and from the top down  this company will keep collapsing under the weight of its own disconnection

reddit,You should be able to pay your COBRA premiums pretax.,"while youre working your employer contributes like 175mo pretax and you contribute like 300mo pretax and somehow that 475 gets you the insurance 

then when youre laid off you get a notice that your cobra continuation coverage will be 900mo and worse this has to be paid posttax unless you itemize medical expenses at which point your out of pocket dollar amount over 10 of your salary has to be pretty high to exceed the standard deduction 

i dont see why cobra is more expensive continued after leaving the company than the combined payments made by employeremployee while employed or why it cant be pretax to start 

an extra grand a month just for insurance that still covers only parts of care makes employment gaps even scarier than rent alone exceeding the unemployment benefits for the month before food utilities insurance or other nondiscretionary expenses are factored in 

cobra should be locked in at the negotiated rate and payable with pretax dollars  we dont have enough safety net to cover housing and healthcare between roles at these high rates",3,1,1m3px7e,2025-07-19T07:09:07,https://www.reddit.com/r/WorkReform/comments/1m3px7e/you_should_be_able_to_pay_your_cobra_premiums/,self,4,0.7696,Positive,-0.4889,Neutral,Workforce

im 18 female and i just graduated from high school i didnt get good grades even though i studied really hard i didnt get into my dream college and my parents cant afford to pay for any kind of university i live in a thirdworld country where its very difficult to find a job and even when you do the pay is extremely low most retail or basic service jobs here pay around 200 a month and thats considered normal

my parents are older tired and theyve worked so hard their whole lives i want to help them and support myself at the same time but i honestly feel stuck i dont want to waste more time i want to do something that will lead to a stable decentpaying career in the next few years even if it takes a lot of effort and learning

theres a community college i could attend but the programs available arent in fields that lead to wellpaying jobs in my country most of them are in education basic office administration or general business im currently teaching myself cybersecurity online im a beginner but i find it interesting and ive heard it can lead to good remote work if you commit to it

i speak arabic french and english fluently and im currently learning german english isnt my first language but ive been learning it for years and feel confident using it i enjoy learning languages and i think im pretty good at it

ive also looked into becoming a flight attendant which i would love but in my country the free tuition programs are only open to people who are 21 or older so thats not an option for now

right now im trying to figure out which path gives me the best chance at financial independence im open to anything that could lead to real sustainable income remote work freelancing tech customer service translationwhatever it takes i dont mind working hard as long as it leads to something better

is cybersecurity a good option for someone in my situation or should i focus on something else that can give results faster can i use my language skills to find remote work how do people in situations like mine get started when they dont have a degree money or connections

ive been working at the clinic for about 78 months now and have been learning a lot the environment is greatthe people are good and for once i feel like im actually doing something meaningful with my life the biggest downside however is the pay and the commute i had to cut down on my hours because the clinic is a 40minute drive and i also need time to commute to school afterward im getting paid 16 an hour which is 3 less than my previous job

initially i was okay with the pay cut because i knew the experience was valuable for my future in veterinary medicine but now im starting to feel the strain i dont have much left to invest buy things for myself or build up my savings i do save about 20 of each paycheck in my highyield savings account but it still feels like im falling behind financially

i applied to company a way back in may and only got the offer this week meanwhile i applied to company b during the first week of july and got an offer just a week later

during my interview with company b the hiring manager asked if i had applied to company a  turns out her husband is the hiring manager there she even told me that shed totally understand if i chose company a since they usually offer better salaries and benefits a few days later company b offered me the role with a basic salary of 75k

from the start of the process with company a their hr and hiring manager told me they were already locking me in since my current role was a perfect fit and their company setup was almost identical to mine the hiring manager even said i was the only one he endorsed for the director interview during our convo i mentioned that i already had an offer from company b he wasnt concerned  he said he knew their budget and that company a could offer more when he asked for my expected salary i said 75k and he replied that it was too low and even wrote down 90k95k on my resume

eventually i was selected for the role at company a but i didnt get the job offer right away  hr said it still had to go through the salary analysis department they asked me for my payslips and even told me to let go of company bs offer because theirs would be much better trusting that i declined company bs offer last week

fast forward to this week  i finally got company as jo and its the same salary im currently getting way lower than company bs offer i told the salary rep that this isnt what i was expecting and mentioned how hr had assured me it would be better than company bs he said hell check if it can be adjusted but if ever it wont be by much

i tried to reach out to company b to see if the offer was still open but they already gave it to someone else

i graduated with a degree in civil engineering in may 2020 had a hard time finding work but a few months in was able to get a job doing menial drafting work worked there for 15 years made 20hour

eventually went on to work for a county government as an engineer in training it was awful a guy just one year older than me was my trainer and he was just a tyrant constantly made me feel terrible couldnt do anything right worked there for 15 years made 2550 an hour

eventually another engineering firm reached out and offered me a position for 34hour to start the next week i declined them because i didnt want to job hop but things got so bad at the county government job that i decided to take the offer funny because the county job actually came out and asked if there was something they could do to get me to stay

by the time i reached out to the other company and asked for the job they had hired another kid that was a semester or two away from graduating with his degree they were still excited to hire me they fired me 7 months in for lack of performance and it was obvious the other guy was preferred over me hurts because i taught him how to use equipment and even helped him with his homework

i really gave that job my all i didnt want a repeat of the county government job

i asked other engineers in my life and online what happened that i got fired i was honest with them with all the mistakes i made and said im willing to hear the harsh truth but they seemed to agree that the company could get the same work for cheaper from the other guy and that because it was a small firm they couldnt afford to keep me just needed a reason to fire me

a couple of days before i was fired my brother died and i became very depressed and took a year off of work because of the depression and to take care of my elderly parents as they grieved just lived off my savings

eventually i move cities and get a new job and say i want no more than 30hour

but i can see it repeating  i need to accept that i have an ego and that i am just not good at things

i have such a chopped up work history that i need this job to last as long as possible i work hard and believe in personal responsibility if im struggling its because its my fault i have nobody to blame but myself i try so hard and just cant to keep up it seems as if i need to realize my limitations and stop asking for engineer pay

mod team members need to be a part of the team we need people who will engage and communicate about what they see and what questions they have our mod team is supportive and understanding we know you have a life outside of reddit and we expect you to put that life first sometimes that means you might have less time to moderate and thats okay we expect communication and coordination so that we can support each other and bring in more help when we need to

 is there anything i should know about moderating rmentalhealth before i apply

yes rmentalhealth is a support community for mental health and we often encounter posts and comments that describe traumatic experiences or crisis some of this content can be disturbing

our team policy is that when a post or comment is too much for one of us to handle we let the rest of the team know and someone else will step in to handle it but there is no way to eliminate the exposure completely

if you apply please expect that we will ask you about your comfort level in moderating content of this nature and what strategies you might use to make sure your own mental health needs are met

no one is expected to address issues that are uncomfortable for them but you should expect to encounter such things if you join the team

second we require that moderators join our discord server where we communicate and coordinate our moderation efforts part of the application process includes joining us on that server for a chat you will need a discord account can be an existing account if you have one

    what does mental health mean to you

reddit,People don’t take ocd seriously enough.,"some people think ocd isnt so bad its something easy to manage and its something that doesnt effect your life that much they think its just slight quirks its so much more than that 

over 5 months ago my real event ocd was triggered by an event ever since its been nonstop stress obsession and even brought me to the brink of ending my life 
its made me believe im a pedo for a period of time made me believe i was the cause of someones death and assault both i eventually realized were untrue 

ive seen people who say they checked themselves into the ward because they believed they were attracted to kids only to be told by the doctors and therapists that it just wasnt true 

it literally makes you believe that 

theres so many types too that arent just real event and pocd its a constant struggle and it really does ruin your entire life my summer was spent just thinking over and over again about my obsessions and thinking im the worst person that im inherently evil my self esteem has become awful 

i dont know what to say except please take ocd seriously and remember that it can be a huge deal in peoples lives please remember to also watch what you say online and in person being unfairly targeted or having things said can lead to really negative outcomes thank you for reading",26,7,1m3lpxe,2025-07-19T03:06:38,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1m3lpxe/people_dont_take_ocd_seriously_enough/,nsfw,33,-0.9711,Negative,0.01132500000000003,Neutral,Mental Health

mild tw violence is mentionedimplied

context for the entire situation is that my partners dad k told us to move my stuff out of his garage in case he needs the space in the future which is fine i didnt like it being there anyway he has forced me to throw away most of my furniture and has repeatedly threatened to throw away everything else i own for multiple unrelated reasons but i digress later that same day i asked him if there was a time limit for when my stuff needed to be out because my partner a and i didnt get paid until the following friday he messaged me back telling me that i need to have integrity and commitment to my responsibilities and that it is a last minute chance before he deals with it i again said we dont have the funds until like3 days later but he was still angry and told us to call me tonight and then didnt respond when we messaged him multiple times what time works best for a phone call he owns a bar and they dont always close at the same time so we were trying to be polite we ended up not calling because he never answered so we thought he was asleep oh my god the next morning he was so angry that we didnt understand that we were to call him at our convenience he ended up scolding us and when i told him why we didnt call got even more angry he then tells us that we can use his car and trailer to get my things and then says he loves us after yelling at us for 20min
fast forward to friday we show up and he suddenly has a new car for a which is great and we thanked him and told him how grateful we were he then switched and started to yell at us that we are disappointments because we didnt call to tell him we were on our way over until we were 1015min away he wasnt even helping us move we just needed to get the garage key car and trailer and head out this lecture than switched to how we failed to get stuff from his exwifes garage for him this was the turning point he said you are to defend and demand my property and when i told him no we cant do that i knew that was a mistake he asked why and i told him its unfair to make a fight your divorce he called me entitled and started walking towards me while pointing and saying how i better listen to him i got scared and yelled at him to stop walking towards me and then he proceeded to disown me and yell at me to get your shit and get out of my life 

i get that yelling wasnt cool on my part but in my defense i was afraid of him getting close to me hes threatened us in the past and has proudly told us and others about times hes beaten up other people i just dont get what happened was i in the wrong here",8,4,1m3lhss,2025-07-19T02:54:59,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1m3lhss/i_told_my_boyfriends_dad_to_stop_pushing_his_son/,self,12,-0.9786,Negative,-0.7987,Negative,Mental Health
reddit,Mental health and drugs destroyed my relationship with my dad and now I feel like I am falling apart,"i am an 18yearold male and my dad is 43 for as long as i can remember my relationship with him has been complicated and painful he has been in and out of jail since i was a child when i was eight years old he went to prison and he did not really come back into my life properly until i was about fifteen that was almost eight years of him being absent during some of the most important years of my childhood i remember one time when he was nearly facing a twentyyear sentence he has always been tied up with drugs and crime and it felt like those things always came first

on top of that he lives with bipolar disorder and schizophrenia while i know that mental illness is not his fault the way he handled it often left me scared and hurt he would switch from being calm and loving to explosive and violent if i did something he did not like or disagreed with him he would lose it he hit me he screamed at me he made me feel like everything was always my fault if i cried it only made him more furious and when i look back now i realise i internalised so much of that i constantly take the blame for things that are not mine to carry i tend to apologise for everything and cry in private because i feel like i am never enough

there were moments where he was actually good i am not going to lie and pretend those times did not matter he took me skydiving once and i remember thinking that maybe he was really going to change he would hug me he would cry and tell me he loved me and say that he was going to get clean for a short while i would believe him but then something small would happen and it would all fall apart every time the good side of him disappeared it felt like those hopeful moments were just lies it made me question whether he ever meant it what was the point of all that good if the violence and pain always followed

recently things got really bad again we had a massive fight and he hit me again that was it for me i packed my things and moved out i now live with my partner and her family and even though i am in a safe space i cannot stop thinking about him it is been almost a month since we last spoke i saw his payslip and noticed that he took a full week off work it hit me hard i started wondering if it is my fault did i break him is he okay what if something happens to him and i am not there i know how quickly he can spiral and it makes me feel sick

the thing is i have always felt like i was the only person keeping him somewhat stable he used to tell me that i was his reason for trying for staying clean for working so now with me gone i feel like he will fall apart and that leaves me drowning in guilt i feel like i am abandoning him even though he hurt me so many times but if i go back i know i will get hurt again

this situation is destroying my mental health now that i am out of it physically i am realising how deep the emotional wounds are i cry a lot when no one is around i feel constantly overwhelmed i feel like i missed out on having a normal childhood and now i am thrown into adulthood without the tools or support i needed growing up i never had a mum in my life and my dad was either in jail high or angry i do not know how to adjust to this new life everything just feels heavy

we have huge admiration and appreciation for the goodwill and good citizenship of so many of you who support others here and flag inappropriate content  even more so because we know that so many of you are struggling yourselves  were hard at work behind the scenes on more information and resources to make it easier to give and get quality help here  this is just a small start  

our new wiki page explains in detail why its much better to respond in public comments at least until youve gotten to know someone  it will be maintained at rdepressionwikiprivate_contact and the full text of the current version is below



summary

anyone who while acting as a helper invites or accepts private contact ie pms chat or any kind of offsite communication early in the conversion is showing either bad intentions or bad judgement  either way its unwise to trust them 


pm me anytime seems like a kind and generous offer and it might be perfectly wellmeaning but unless and until a solid rapport has been established its just not a wise idea  here are some points to consider before you offer or accept an invitation to communicate privately

 by posting supportive replies publicly youll help more people than just the op if your responses are of good quality youll educate and inspire other helpers the 1990 rule applies here as much as it does anywhere else on the internet  

 people who are struggling with serious mentalhealth issues often justifiably have a low tolerance for disappointment and a highlevel of everchanging emotional need unless the helper is able to make a 100 commitment to be there for them in every way for as long as necessary offering a personal inbox as a resource is likely to do more harm than good this is why mentalhealth crisisline responders usually dont give their names and callers arent allowed to request specific responders  its much healthier and safer for the callers to develop a relationship with the agency as a whole  analogously its much safer and healthier for our ops to develop a relationship with the community as a whole  even trained responders are generally not allowed to work highintensity situations alone  its partly about availability but its mostly about wider perspective and preventing compassion fatigue 

 if a helper gets in over their head with someone whose mentalhealth issues including suicidality which is often comorbid with depression escalate in a pm conversation its much harder for others including the rdepression and rsuicidewatch moderators to help  contrary to common assumptions moderators cant see or police pms  

 in our observation over many years the people who say pm me the most are consistently the ones with the least understanding of mentalhealth issues and mentalhealth support we all have gaps in our knowledge and in our ability to communicate effectively  community input mitigates these limitations theres no reason why someone whos truly here to help would want to hide their responses from community scrutiny  if helpers are concerned about their own privacy keep in mind that selfdisclosure when used supportively is more about the feelings than the details and that we have no problem here with the use of altthrowaway accounts and have no restrictions on account age or karma  

  we all know the internet is used by some people to exploit or abuse others  these people do want to hide their deceptive and manipulative responses from everyone except their victims there are many of them who specifically target those who are vulnerable because of mentalhealth issues if a helper invites an op to talk privately and gives them a good supportive experience theyve primed that person to be more vulnerable to abusers this sort of cognitive priming tends to be particularly effective when someones in a state of mentalhealth crisis when people rely more on heuristics than critical reasoning

 if ops want to talk privately posting on a wideopen anonymous forum like reddit might not be the best option although we dont recommend it we do allow ops to request private contact when asking for support if you want to do this please keep your expectations realistic and to have a careful look at the history of anyone who offers to pm before opening up to them",2360,177,doqwow,2019-10-29T14:52:02,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/doqwow/our_mostbroken_and_leastunderstood_rules_is/,,2537,0.9973,Positive,0.29084,Neutral,Mental Health
reddit,"Regular check-in post, with essential information about our rules and resources","welcome to rdepressions checkin post  a place to take a moment and share what is going on and how you are doing if youre having a tough time but prefer not to make your own post or have an accomplishment you want to talk about these arent allowed standalone posts in the sub as they violate the role model rule  this is a place you can share



our subreddit rules are very different from most of the rest of reddit  since all of them exist for important reasons we ask everyone here to read and follow them please click report on any harmful content you see here  we always want to know and deal as soon as we can

we also have several resource wikis for help with finding and giving support

 provides guidance about what is and isnt a depressive disorder guidance on the complex nature of the illnesses that are usually grouped under the depression label and redirect information for common offtopic issues

 offers information on the nature and value of peer support for mentalhealth issues in general and lots of guidance for learning what is  and isnt  usually helpful in giving peer support

ysk that the types of rule violations that we most frequently see here are

 people breaking the private contact rule you should never trust anyone who tries to get you into a private conversation in response to a post here see 

 im here to help posts this shows that you dont understand the most basic principles of peer support especially selectivity the giving help wiki explains more about this

 role modelling ie achievement or advice posts this is an expertfree zone  thats what peer support means rule 5 we know that internet culture celebrate not just bragging about your achievements but bragging about your good intentions nothing like that is ever acceptable here

 content thats more about making a statement or casually polling the sub than seeking personal support  rules 1 2 and 10

 offtopic posts about difficult situations or circumstances including interpersonal issues grief sadness anger loneliness and other difficult emotions are not mental illnesses the what is depression wiki has suggestions for other places to post about these issues which are 100 valid and serious but inappropriate here",41,107,1jys8x9,2025-04-14T06:26:08,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1jys8x9/regular_checkin_post_with_essential_information/,,148,0.9558,Positive,-0.32534,Neutral,Mental Health
reddit,I did not expect so many suicide notes,"i just stumbled across here and this was so unexpected 

i thought of course that people will describe their problems how they struggle with depression what a torture the day to day is but reading through made me immediately want to write to you 

i know what hopelessness feels like i am actually feeling it right this second you are absolutely right that it would be so much better to just disappear and not have to live this life death sounds like a release from the torture that everyday is 

im just taking it day by day and clinging onto what little hope i have left and i hope youll join me instead of taking your life i hope youll choose the harder path which is this to believe in something that you cannot feel cannot see cannot hear 

believe that it wont always stay this way that there is a day in the future whether near or far where you will feel sad thinking about dying because you have so much to live for 

believe that there is a day in the future where you wake up and just live your life and its a good life 

no matter how hopeless it seems as long as there is life there is hope 

hope will die with you or live on in you

reddit,I survived a suicide attempt today. My mind is clear now. Perspective change?,"short back story grew up in a nonideal environment and never learned good coping mechanisms been struggling with depression for the last 20 years have had bouts of suicidal phases with some lasting a few months and one time lasted a year

recently got into a suicidal phase again due to a relationship ending i realized that i had been pushing my depression down all these years even though ive been successful in other areas of my life except for relationship building the break up broke me

ive been bedridden due to depression for the last two weeks and i ordered some rope to try to hang myself today when it was only supposed to be a test run i ended up not being able to free myself for a few minutes i was gasping for air the whole time and kept trying to loosen it and at times i almost just gave up but i kept fighting my whole life flashed in front of my eyes and i kept struggling to want to stay around to fight another day it kept going dark and i keep waking back up luckily it was not constricting the vein that wouldve made me pass out and finally after struggling i was able to pull it off of me my face was all red and my lips were blue by the time i got myself to the bathroom my lip color quickly returned but my throat still hurts

the first thing i said to myself when i got back to breathing was yelling at myself and said its not worth it i threw all the rope i had away in the garbage can rigth away now im able to compartmentalize and realized only because i messed up one area of my life in this one relationship doesnt mean i need to give up on all of it i now recognize where my problem in life is which is my chronic depression im going to get on medication and try everything i can to help myself so i dont fail again and i need to expand my life more so i dont become fixated on just one thing and maybe i learned something about myself i need to figure myself out and do whats right for me moving forward and be careful

trying to rebuild your life while staring down rent bills job interviews its like youre expected to emotionally heal and immediately perform like nothing happened
and ive actually been doing okay i went back to work im paying my own way again im functioning but anxiety just doesnt care

most days i feel like im living in a cortisol hell
that tight scalp feeling the hunched shoulders the constant dread like something bad is always about to happen im so so tired

so ive been reading up on prt psychological recovery theory and how cortisol works and something caught my attention exposure to simulated natural environments can reduce cortisol levels and support psychological recovery even just visual exposure  trees skies water stars

it reminded me  when i was younger i used to love watching stars id sit out on the roof or at the window at night and just stare it always made me feel small in a comforting way like the universe was holding me instead of swallowing me

now im wondering  would it be completely silly if i tried recreating that a little in my bedroom ive seen those galaxy projectors like pococo and some of them actually look kind of beautiful like they project slowmoving stars underwater light patterns soft moonscapes

reddit,WTF is happening? Help me!,"a voice barely audible cries out in the distance an old lay floats by clutching onto her mattress submerged in flooding waters a few seconds later a branch succumbs and lands on top of her as i loose sight while they sink in the torrent of undercurrents im clutching my children on top of my roof praying that the structure holds my wife is with her sister and the kids was a last minute decision just a day longer to finish the contract and get paid the job wasnt far and they were going to spend their time with the neighbors kids safe and in the car the next day a little time with her sister

its so loud everywhere the water the kids everything crashing and dragging it along surreal as i hold onto my children in my jeans and tshirt in their pajamas which are soaking we they are shivering cold

im in trouble i was told what to do and i forgot just about everything its all down there somewhere if it hasnt floated away i got the life jackets and the first aid kit maybe the emergency boat will inflate itself and rise to the surface ive got insurance on my phone and maybe ill connect to her and let her know we are alive and safe for a while up here i keep telling them to hold on and everything will be okay we need to look after each other its an experience you cant capture on a screen because you are too busy thinking about way more important things thats the irony

its too loud now and there are just so many voices and sounds its difficult to hear but we all have skin in the game the destroyed remnants of the church come crashing down the avenue the lord almighty might not have built it but where ever its going it sure is in a hurry call it what you like but that water sure looks like the difference between life and death to me i couldnt call myself anything but feeling a little closer to what god not matter what you believe holding my children screaming as loud as i can that everything is going to be okay i just cant shush myself loud enough for them to hear yet thats where i find myself barely motionless in shock while also keenly aware of what really matters and what really is going on

im not sure if she would recognize me an iron grip on her wrist bringing her along to get our children that ego which would take over and a man protects his wife and children im so stupid this way i would gamble my own safety for the sake of my family but everyone knows safety is not a party of one at least i hope that everyone can agree on that one thing is for sure shell know that shes not alone when calling the shots and the last minute changes shell know the difference between the pets and the children it pains me to recall everything is going to be okay

on second thought shell be putting me to work so much i probably wouldnt have time to think wed be sailing off into the sunset if we didnt get crushed along the way the mind works in mysterious ways remain calm and hold onto your children the louder it gets the more clarity i receive as to my true meaning and purpose  i missed my wife and loved my children in a way i never imagined i desperately hoped the neighbors were okay what else can you do while waiting to be rescued after exhausting every possible opportunity what a sobering reality when every conceivable chemical and blood cell discovers what it takes to stay alive yet somewhere i store it in case i live to tell the tale

you know why i think safety is never a party of one because i am human and im smart enough to know that theres a whole lot more riding on it than i can possibly imagine we really need to be more sensitive to the fact that your safety is more than just yours not because its a choice but an evitable outcome im glad that i am alive but more glad that my children are too its a team effort that money just cant afford",0,3,1lw5s1t,2025-07-10T06:34:19,https://www.reddit.com/r/NaturalDisasters/comments/1lw5s1t/wtf_is_happening_help_me/,self,3,0.9965,Positive,0.62415,Positive,Disasters

im seeing differing reports on varying news sources regarding exactly what happened though and who is at fault  the wife claims the technologist actually let him into the room to assist her in getting off the table the above article merely says the entry was unauthorized and yet another article cites a witness going so far as to say he defied orders to stay out of the room after he heard a patient his relative screaming during a scan i really really hope the latter is the most true but how on earth did a completely unscreened patient get close enough to the magnet room to hear his wife screaming much less enter it unhindered

fwiw the wife also reports she and the technician tried to pull her husband off of the machine to no avail just in case this is true and its possible there is an mri tech that dumb out there this is never ever ever ever going to work quench immediately you have to wonder if the guy could have survived if she did",418,125,1m48i4l,2025-07-19T22:10:02,https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/1m48i4l/man_dies_after_being_pulled_into_mri_machine/,,543,-0.3948,Neutral,0.011020000000000007,Neutral,Healthcare
reddit,Would you break patient confidentiality in this scenario? Patient fell asleep behind the wheel and refused investigation.,"optometrist 

saw a patient 60m today who wanted an eye exam after falling asleep whilst driving 

exam showed signs of elevated cholesterol but barring that was pretty unremarkable not currently taking any medications but not had a blood test for at least 25 years

explained to patient this must be investigated to rule out an underlying cause he refuses referral to his general practitioner on the basis that will make it official and he might lose his licence 

after some reluctant questioning he confesses this has happened before which caused him to have a car crash at this point he was quite reserved and angry but he says it was 40 years ago and the cause was he needed glasses obviously this is bs he didnt wear glasses till around a decade ago so hes clearly lying somewhere 

px adamantly refused referral and further investigation despite explaining he could kill someone 

would you break confidentiality and inform the general practitioner to investigate and report to the licencing authority regardless

reddit,Am I being too sensitive?,"i want to receive your feedback about my current job in the er a tertiary hospital ive been there for a little over a month i have scheduled two 24hr and six 19hr shifts on top of the regular schedule the experience has been extremely tough and my initial plan was to stay until september 30 for two reasons

1 im learning a lot here more than anywhere else before and thats helping me with my mir exam preparation
2 im saving a lot of money in a short period of time

but the environment is toxic and hostile and every day its getting harder heres whats been happening

 every morning there are meetings to discuss the number of patients seen the manager comes almost every day for the same reason and to take photos
 during almost every shift they ask me how many patients im seeing or even call the consultation room at 56 am just to check if im awake
 the head of the department publicly says that the last 45 doctors hired including me are slower and less effective even though we havent received proper training courses
 my coworkers have been hostile since the day i defended myself they scolded me for going to lunch without asking them first and i replied that when im in car another er section nobody asks me if i want to eat since then ive become their target
 yesterday for instance they left me about 8 followup patients to review and claimed i was seeing too few patients while they bragged about seeing 9 patients in just 4 hours which i highly doubt for the simple reason that nurses hadnt provided the files of the patients pending to be seen
 nurses disregard my medical orders i told them about 10 times not to place a reservoir on a cystic fibrosis patient yesterday yet they did it because a senior doctor said so that leaves me legally exposed
 sometimes they lie saying they didnt know where i was even though i always work in the same spot i dont sit with them because its noisy and the phone rings constantly
 when i said goodbye this morning nobody even replied

on top of that the shifts are brutal

 the 24hour shifts are completely sleepless after yesterdays shift i feel drunk staggering like a hangover and i dont even drink
 they tell me i need to talk to them before going to lunch so the er isnt left unattended but they dont do the same for me its not all but a few do this
 i rarely leave on time i almost always finish much later than scheduled

i feel like ive already been labeled as the target and nothing i do will change that perception im mentally and physically exhausted my plan was to stay until late september to save money and strengthen my clinical knowledge before focusing fully on mir prep but im not sure if sacrificing my mental and physical health is worth it

reddit,I tried a lot of AI medical scribes so you don't have to - my honest review,"hi everyone

im a family doc who also does hospitalist work and im a big tech geek on the side ever since ai scribes started popping up i got super curious that one of them could help out with charting i posted this to the rfamilymedicine group and it got a lot of traction so thought id post the new and updated list here too heres my honest take after spending about a year hopping between them  
  
1 vero scribe 79month  
underdog but this is probably my favourite one that i keep returning to after customizing the template the learn feature is probably the biggest game changer for me and probably many others it learns how you like your notes formatted and outputs all future notes like that accuracy has also been great which is the most important feature to most of us

2 freed ai 99month  
very basic but i think thats the point its dead simple to use which i guess is a plus but it felt like there wasnt much flexibility just a few templates and not much ability to tweak how it works output was good for simple visits but not robust enough for my more complex cases

3 heidi health free tier or 99month  
not a bad scribe and generates consistent notes i paid for the premium because i like my custom templates to generate notes exactly how i like them their chat functionality doesnt answer medical questions which i find a medical scribe should be able to do also they seem really slow to add new features their public roadmap is full of coming soon stuff thats been sitting there forever

4 nabla 119month  
same vibe as freed clean ui but felt barebones if you want something super simple itll do the trick but most of us need more control and accuracy lacks a lot of specialtycustom options

5 scribeberry 99month  
i couldnt get behind this one the output just wasnt accurate for a lot of cases some errors in phrasing missed important negatives in the ros etc did not stick around long enough to keep trying out all the features

6 tali ai 150month  
this ones really popular but my notes came out weirdly formatted and sometimes missed key details or summarized in a way that felt off also they use their chrome plugin as their main selling point but id rather it not see all my web browsing history when im not doing clinical related duties

other stuff i noticed

 privacyphi most claim data is encryptedsecure and stays in uscanadaeurope but always check some are pretty transparent about it others just claim but have no backing
 emr integration none of these are true plugandplay in my emr but most of them have these features on the way
 cost heidi has a free tier but there are not many templates to choose from and i ended up paying the 99month anyways tali came in at the most expensive at 150month for their premium tier

would love to hear what other peoples experiences have been especially if youve used any others i missed i would love to try them out happy to answer any questions hope you find this useful and happy charting",91,54,1m3d8wr,2025-07-18T20:35:50,https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/1m3d8wr/i_tried_a_lot_of_ai_medical_scribes_so_you_dont/,,145,0.998,Positive,0.32778,Neutral,Healthcare

i returned the call the same day and started by apologizing for the discomfort this patient experienced i think my use of the word discomfort was a trigger and the patient immediately became very upset and launched into a monologue accusing me of not appreciating the level of pain caused calling me a bullshitter and hanging up before i could respond

i tried again about an hour later hoping the patient might be more receptive i started by acknowledging the pain this patient experienced but this only seemed to heighten the frustration the patient went on to say the office was inept called me a pathetic human being and threatened to leave a negative reviewthen hung up again before i could say anything further

fortunately my office was able to arrange a followup with one of my colleagues whos been given a heads up at this point it feels like a dead end trying to engage further the whole experience has been a real shock and im left feeling anxious and demoralized im not sure what to do at this point other than seeing if the inevitable complaint or bad review shows up",189,78,1m1vtdl,2025-07-17T02:25:59,https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/1m1vtdl/how_do_you_veterans_cope_with_not_feeling/,,267,-0.9935,Negative,0.81768,Positive,Healthcare

reddit,New ChatGPT agent mode:imagine the future if it could use the EMR,"what do you think emrs will look like in five years


go watch the demo videos if you havent its crazy  i cant help but think that an emr that a tool like this could interact with easily would enable true automation and potentially in the near future  the focus could shift from ui based tools to make data entry and retrievalanalysis easier to a solid foundation that an ai agent could use easily  the user experience then could be primarily interacting with the data using natural language to establish preferences they are already so good at presenting data different ways and then an agent could write the note place the orders update the problem list the avs the whole thing  for sure the provider would need to review everything with a fine toothed comb but it really seems like true automation could be possible in the near future

its not just a hypothetical  their agent can read everything on a screen summarize what it sees click around write and follow customized instructions 

i would love to work in a world where i spend almost the entire appointment time talking with the patient where the data i need is easily accessible however i want it and i can spend time in between patients reading learning and teaching instead of playing secretary  and it really doesnt seem that far off at all  the tech is there we just need the implementation

what do you think emrs will look like in five years

i work for a large westcoast multispecialty health system that works in a largefullrisk model  therefore there is incentive to provide care efficiently

as such the system relies heavily on the patient portal encouraging patients to email your doctor which they doexuberantly  

to my knowledge they were the 1st system to implement this nationally and at first it was relatively reasonable

but over the years as access to care has become harder and copaycoinsurance barriers have risen the volume and complexity of care that patient are trying to receive via securemessage has become insane especially in primary care  the average pcp in our organization received 4070 per day in addition to their full schedule of patients and other carecoordination related tasks

i see posts on here from docs who seem to be in the privatepay world and wonder if you guys also have patient messages and if so why you put up with the  it would seem like they would detract from rvu generation giving away medical expertise for free  if you do how do you keep the volume from getting out of hand like in our system",27,17,1m1npyq,2025-07-16T20:32:54,https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/1m1npyq/doe_ffs_docs_participate_in_some_form_of/,,44,0.993,Positive,0.8147800000000001,Positive,Healthcare

reddit,Reflecting and Looking for Guidance,"hello

this post is somewhat a vent but just also just kind of looking for an outlet and possibly some guidance perhaps from perspective of new attending or more seasoned attendings

im a first gen doctor dont have any other doctors in the family or anyone to bounce off of for experience or guidance studied really hard in school was fortunate enough to get into a usmd program and graduated in 2023 now currently in a pediatrics residency at my home program

thankfully my program in not malignant and they seem to support me well im going into my 3rd and final year of residency

i just keep feeling this sense emptiness at times and somewhat some regrets my undergrad was very malignant and the professors were a bunch of jerks my med school i really just felt like a number wasnt a gem of the class tried my best while pretty much doing my whole residency transitioned after covid pandemic started beginning of school family went through some hardships during my time with school which correlated with covid and job insecurity but nobody really cared

i had actually matched into pediatrics which was not my first choice specialty but i always loved the pediatric patients and i have grown to be more fond of it and i really enjoy my patients

i guess what stirred me along in med school was that i was really seeking fulfillment while also achieving financial security in a time that that was very tough

i just dont have many people to look up to or ask for advice part of me is thinking that im almost done and i can get a job another part of me is saying perhaps you should do a fellowship or try and do another residency to increase your salary and fullfillment or achievement status i can go to more in detail in a dm but that is kind of where im at im a single man in my late 20s

there is no scientific justification for the use of azithromycin in the treatment of covid19 up to now pubmed

  
our findings are in line with available evidence that does not recommend the use of azithromycin as effective treatment for patients with sarscov2 infection and raise concern on risks associated with inappropriate use of this drug science direct

  
the nih recommends against the use of antibacterial therapy eg azithromycin doxycycline for non hospitalized covid19 patients unless there is another medical reason to prescribe an antibiotic drugscom

reddit,I told the doctor my mom was lying about my symptoms,"15f 5 80lbs 

i posted here once before because i knew my mom was lying about me being sicker than i was and i wasnt sure how to handle it 
i took everyones advice and i ended up telling them at the next appointment after we checked in i said i had to go to the bathroom and i left a note with a nurse i think my doctor maybe looked at it before the appointment actually because it took a really long time for us to go back and then in the appointment the doctor was asking a lot more probing questions and clarifying questions and pointing out inconsistencies my mom said and then he asked to talk to me by myself and my mom by herself too actually 

so im seeing a a team of doctors now who wanted to verify some of the diagnosis that i had and they admitted me to do that like in the hospital and there was always a nurse or someone in my room with me 
im not 100 sure because no one actually told me this is why but im guessing it was to make sure my mom didnt say or do anything or give me anything is that something theyd actually do it sounds so dramatic or maybe its normal to check things out in the hospital like that idk 

anyway theyre changing some of my diagnoses now and my mom is talking with a counselor she still maintains thats shes not doing anything to me and im really sick and just getting influenced by crime documentaries adding she caught me listening to the podcast for context but things are a little better shes not supposed to be in charge of any of my meds now i do that myself and i write down everything i take and when in a journal so theres a record and im not taking the hydroxychloroquine anymore

we also found out that he had passed meconium before delivery and it was never mentioned and we never received treatment of any kind for it from what i can see in the documentation after

but something strange happened today

i was eating italian pizza with a friend and he mentioned it was spicy as usual i didnt feel anything later that night i stayed up late and made my usual spicy noodlesthe same ones ive been eating once or twice a week always with the spicy seasoning

this time though i felt it the spiciness hit me in my mouth again for the first time in almost a year it was such a strange sensation after going so long without it even more surprising i started reacting to milder things that never felt spicy to me before

ive always had this certain pain around an old appendectomy scar for years which sometimes made it difficult to stretch and hurt me every time i sneezed unless i sit in a certain position sometimes it hurt so badly i had to freeze whether i was walking standing or sitting the best i can describe this pain is sudden and sharp tight and throbbing or like someone is stabbing me with something extremely sharp 

but around 2023 the pain seemed to have spread and intensified i now experience this or a strong ache at the top of my spine my shoulder blades my upper ribs pelvis my inner thighs my rear my fingers and knuckles my ankles and my toes it always gets worse when it rains because of this i had to quit my job since it repeatedly interfered with my ability to work

and recently my fingers feel like they are being shocked by electricity just for brushing them against something or accidentally but gently bumping them against say the corner of my phone i get a shock this never happened before im not sure what to look into for this especially since i cant afford to visit a doctor im assuming its a nerve issue but im not sure",3,1,1m4hgug,2025-07-20T05:57:37,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/1m4hgug/i_think_i_have_nerve_issues_but_i_cant_afford_to/,,4,-0.9329,Negative,0.8779,Positive,Healthcare

reddit,"Should I take SO(29F) to ER for worsening, nightly left side numbness, swelling/pain, right side pressure headache, nausea, family history of MS.","i am taking her to the doctor when we can get in days weeks months but _is this an emergency_

current medications duloxetine 4 months atomoxetine 3 weeks unsure exact dosage assume the basic starting dosage

summary shes 29 female 59 160lb born in iran residing in america she has a family history of ms its a direct family member though she hasnt told me exactly who she has been getting right sided pressure headaches with nausea for years typically spread out but always having localized pain behind right eye they have recently gotten worse she also has swelling and pain in her left foot constantly for weeks pain in her left shoulder intermittently numbness usually around left ear sometimes other places she had the headaches before she started the medication everything else has developed within the last 36 months progression does not happen within the night it happens between nights like each night is pretty stable and not heavily declining but it is a slow progression across nights and its not quite every night but more and more of them

previous evaluation two years ago she was evaluated with an mri without contrast apparently not a specific area of focus but unsure for her pressure headaches they apparently found nothing

swelling and pain during stressful period last year she had swelling and pain on her left ring finger that didnt go away for months recently she has gained new swelling and pain on her left foot and pain in her left shoulder that hasnt gone away for a couple weeks it arose during high stress period were phd students its always high stress 

headaches and nausea almost nightly now shell get episodes of these headaches and nausea it really cripples her and she basically can only just lay down until she falls asleep i havent seen her throw up from it but she does get nausea more generally sometimes probably due to medication described above she needs to eat before going anywhere and gets motion sickness in the car

numbness a couple months ago during a headache she put ice on her right eye for 3 hours afterwards she had numbness around her left ear the sensation is also accompanied by the feeling of slight swelling like if i touch it feels like the touch is about an inch further away from her head than it should be i can almost reliably reproduce this numbness and bigness sensation by having her bend her neck back andor to the sides returning head to upright will resolve that numbness within a minute or two but it separately happens in conjunction with headaches as well not just upon movement of the neck shes told me tonight that it feels worse like its deeper bigger area longer duration tiny pressure towards inside for a bit of it it has also happened to her leg while we were walking to my car a week ago and in her arm very rarely she says it almost feels like the pins and needs of a sleeping limb but its more blunted and dull numb strange

other health issues a heart arrhythmia that only happens during rare stress shes been told its nothing to worry about i dont know the specific type 

chatgpt is telling me shes gonna die google is telling me shes gonna die ive been begging her to go to the doctor but shes very resistant i think shes starting to get scared though because this is the first night shes admitted she might need to go is this urgent do i need to get her to an emergency room tonight within the next week what do i do please help my mom died from waiting too long and i cant let that happen again shes asleep now i dont live with her and she is not here",3,2,1m4h3tc,2025-07-20T05:35:30,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/1m4h3tc/should_i_take_so29f_to_er_for_worsening_nightly/,,5,-0.996,Negative,0.8779,Positive,Healthcare

reddit,"6-weeks-old nephew probably suffers from Encephalopathy. We are devastated and unsure about what to expect, still waiting for a definitive and more specific diagnosis.","my sister and her husband bore a child last june 6th it was really hard for her to get pregnant they tried for 2 years or so and also got involved in fertility treatments she has also been extremely careful and applied measures to prevent their child getting sick from other people

everything seemed fine sure the child was quite irritable he looked a bit lostabsent but thats expected from a newborn as the days passed by it started to develop some sudden wideeye movements to the sides without any apparent stimuli it also seemed like he was sometimes startled by something however it wasnt something extremely obvious and maybe it was just some of the odd things newborns do they visited the doctor twice or three times during the first 34 weeks especially because of the persisting crying it was advised a change in the formula and nothing more initially the baby didnt gain enough weight but it eventually stabilized so nothing looked like an emergency

the eye movement became more obvious the parents recorded the baby and sent the video to the doctor then the nightmare started the baby was hospitalized was subjected to a myriad of tests

it was then confirmed that my nephew suffers from seizures from what i was told it seems like it is suspected genetic or metabolic encephalopathy

the baby was administered a drug to stop the seizures and apparently hes responsive after taking the drug the random eyemovement stops for a while and he focuses and is even actually responsive to his parents talking to him which the neurologist is glad to see

i only know iron deficiency was detected and liver enzymes were found to be outside normal values indicating potential hepatic involvement but the tests are in general fine

these labs are currently being repeated for confirmation many more studies are to come and this week they have appointments with several specialists apparently the cause has not been found and thats why theyll even see a cardiologist as apparently a heart disease can also be the cause

however it seems like they are shooting in the dark i do not even understand if treatment is still possible whether my nephew will suffer from mental retardation or if he will even survive

today they have returned to their home but thats because according to the doctor there is no reason to keep the baby hospitalized because all the possible causes that require urgent treatment have been discarded so they can safely wait in their home for the results of the remaining studies that is the remaining possible causes either have no treatment i dont understand if that means the baby eventually will die or be disabled or are treatable but its treatment is not urgent

at this point im also shooting in the dark as well i contacted some health institutions abroad im from argentina but they havent reached me back yet we are extremely worried and personally im confused as well since i dont even understand the diagnosis or lack of it and the possible outcome any kind of opinions and past experiences are welcome",3,2,1m4fvai,2025-07-20T04:22:09,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/1m4fvai/6weeksold_nephew_probably_suffers_from/,,5,-0.9246,Negative,0.8779,Positive,Healthcare
