## 💡 Inspiration

BuzzBoard began with a belief:  
**Data isn’t just statistical — it’s emotional.**

Every Reddit comment, every news article, carries a pulse.  
BuzzBoard blends media tone and public dialogue to show how the internet *feels* — one topic, one emotion, one platform at a time.

It’s more than sentiment analysis.  
It’s a window into human expression at scale.

> 🐝 Built with empathy, curiosity, and a passion for emotionally intelligent storytelling.
